--- Query 1: What is an API? ---

[Context 1]
An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, acts as an intermediary that enables different software applications to communicate with each other. It provides a set of rules and tools that allow one application to request data or services from another. For instance, a weather app utilizes an API to retrieve the latest weather data from a server. APIs are crucial for several reasons: * **Connecting Applications:** They facilitate the sharing of data and features between applications...

[Context 2]
An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, acts as a bridge between different software applications, allowing them to communicate, share data, and collaborate. It defines a common language that enables one application to request data or trigger processes from another without needing to understand its internal workings. APIs are fundamental to modern software development, facilitating efficient interaction between applications, services, and systems, and are used in a wide range ...

[Context 3]
An API, which stands for application programming interface, is a set of protocols and instructions written in programming languages like C++ or JavaScript. These define how two software components communicate with each other. Unlike a user interface, APIs operate behind the scenes to enable users to find and retrieve requested information. They function like contracts that govern how two software systems interact. APIs are essential for user experience (UX) and are commonly encountered when brow...

--- Query 2: What do developers use APIs for? ---

[Context 1]
Developers use APIs for several key reasons: * **Connecting Applications:** APIs enable different software applications to communicate and share data or features. A prime example is how a ride-sharing app uses the Google Maps API to display real-time driver locations. * **Saving Time:** By reusing existing APIs, developers don't need to build functionalities from scratch, which significantly speeds up the development process. * **Powering Modern Technology:** APIs are fundamental to most online ...

[Context 2]
Developers use APIs for several key purposes: * **Interoperability:** To enable different software systems, which may be developed by different vendors or run on different platforms, to communicate with each other. * **Integration:** To connect disparate applications, services, and databases, allowing them to work together seamlessly. This enables a "lego block" approach to software development, reducing development time and costs. * **Innovation & Ecosystems:** To foster new applications and se...

As defined in the candidate article, an API is a set of rules and definitions that allows applications to communicate with each other. This enables developers to access data or functionality from external services without needing to know their internal implementations.\n\nThe communication process typically involves a client application sending a request to a server application through the API. The API acts as a contract between the client (requesting a service) and the server (providing it). It receives the client's request, forwards it to the server, and then returns the server's response back to the client. This facilitates the secure exchange of data and verification between applications.\n\nFor example, when a weather app requests current weather data for a city, it sends a GET request to a specific API endpoint (a URL exposed by the API). The server processes this request and returns a response, often in a structured format like JSON, containing the requested information. Key components facilitating this include:\n*   **Endpoints:** Specific URLs for accessing API functionalities.\n*   **Requests and Responses:** Applications send requests (e.g., using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and receive responses, which include status codes and data.\n*   **Authentication:** APIs often require authentication (e.g., API keys) to ensure only authorized applications can interact.\n\nThis mechanism allows one application to access specific features or data from another without needing to understand its complex internal workings, simplifying integration and data sharing across various software services.",

API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and definitions that
allows applications to communicate with each other. Developers use APIs to access
data or functionality from external services without knowing their internal implementations.

This abstraction simplifies integration, accelerates development, and allows developers to build new applications and services by leveraging existing functionalities. This also facilitates the reuse of code, reduces development time, and enhances security by abstracting internal system details. For instance, a weather app can use a weather API to display forecasts without needing to collect data itself, or a payment gateway API can process transactions securely.

======== ITER 3 — Editor Output (New Document) ========
API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and definitions that
allows applications to communicate with each other.
This communication typically follows a client-server model, where a client application sends a request to a server application through the API. The API processes this request, often using standard HTTP methods (like GET for retrieving data or POST for sending data) and specific URLs (endpoints), and then the server returns a response, often in a structured data format like JSON or XML.
 Developers use APIs to access
data or functionality from external services without knowing their internal implementations.

This abstraction simplifies integration, accelerates development, and allows developers to build new applications and services by leveraging existing functionalities. This also facilitates the reuse of code, reduces development time, and enhances security by abstracting internal system details. For instance, a weather app can use a weather API to display forecasts without needing to collect data itself, or a payment gateway API can process transactions securely.## Why Developers Use APIs

Query: What is an API?

Number of contexts: 3

[Context 1]
An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, acts as an intermediary that enables different software applications to communicate with each other. It provides a set of rules and tools that allow one application to request data or services from another. For instance, a weather app utilizes an API to retrieve the latest weather data from a server. APIs are crucial for several reasons: * **Connecting Applications:** They facilitate the sharing of data and features between applications...

[Context 2]
An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, acts as a bridge between different software applications, allowing them to communicate, share data, and collaborate. It defines a common language that enables one application to request data or trigger processes from another without needing to understand its internal workings. APIs are fundamental to modern software development, facilitating efficient interaction between applications, services, and systems, and are used in a wide range ...

[Context 3]
An API, which stands for application programming interface, is a set of protocols and instructions written in programming languages like C++ or JavaScript. These define how two software components communicate with each other. Unlike a user interface, APIs operate behind the scenes to enable users to find and retrieve requested information. They function like contracts that govern how two software systems interact. APIs are essential for user experience (UX) and are commonly encountered when brow...

Developers use APIs for several key reasons: * **Connecting Applications:** APIs enable different software applications to communicate and share data or features. A prime example is how a ride-sharing app uses the Google Maps API to display real-time driver locations. * **Saving Time:** By reusing existing APIs, developers don't need to build functionalities from scratch, which significantly speeds up the development process. * **Powering Modern Technology:** APIs are fundamental to most online ...
