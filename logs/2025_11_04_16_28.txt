## What is an API? An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules or protocols that enables software applications to communicate with each other to exchange data, features and functionality. APIs simplify and accelerate application and software development by enabling developers to integrate data, services and capabilities from other applications, instead of developing them from scratch. Today, most APIs are web APIs. Web APIs are a type of remote API (meaning that the API uses ...

API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, definitions, and protocols that
allows applications to communicate with each other. Developers use APIs to access
data or functionality from external services without knowing their internal implementations.This abstraction means developers don't need to understand the underlying database structure, server-side logic, or specific programming languages used by the service.


These rules dictate how applications make requests (API calls) and receive responses. Developers consult API documentation to understand the specific protocols, data formats (schemas), and security requirements for interacting with a service. This structured approach ensures seamless data exchange and functionality access.
