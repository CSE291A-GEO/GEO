[Context 3]
Using an API (Application Programming Interface) differs from needing to know an external service's internal implementations in that an API acts as an intermediary, providing a defined set of rules and protocols for different applications to communicate. This allows developers to access specific functionalities or data within a system without needing to understand the underlying code or how the system operates internally. The document uses an analogy of a restaurant: * The menu represents the AP...

Developers leverage APIs to access data or functionality from external services *without needing to know their internal implementations*.\n\nThis differs significantly from needing to understand internal implementations because APIs act as an intermediary, abstracting away the complexity of the underlying system. Instead of delving into how an external service stores data, processes requests, or manages its internal logic, developers interact with a defined interface that specifies what requests can be made, what parameters are accepted, and what responses to expect. This standardized interaction simplifies access, reduces complexity, and allows external services to change their internal workings without breaking integrations, as long as the API contract remains consistent. APIs also often include built-in security measures, providing controlled access without exposing the internal architecture.",

======== Evaluator: Query & Contexts ========
Query: What is the key distinction an API provides regarding internal implementation knowledge?

Number of contexts: 3

[Context 1]
The key distinction an API provides regarding internal implementation knowledge is that it abstracts away the internal workings. This means that users of the API do not need to know how the underlying system is implemented to use it. The API acts as an interface, exposing only the necessary functionalities and data, while keeping the complex internal logic hidden. This allows for changes and improvements to the internal implementation without affecting the external consumers of the API, as long ...

[Context 2]
The key distinction an API provides regarding internal implementation knowledge is abstraction. APIs act as simplified interfaces that hide the complexities of underlying systems, allowing developers to access functionalities and data without needing to understand the intricate details of how they are implemented internally. This abstraction layer streamlines development, enhances flexibility, and promotes scalability by decoupling the interface from the implementation.

[Context 3]
The key distinction an API provides regarding internal implementation knowledge is that it acts as an interface, allowing different software components or services to communicate and collaborate efficiently without needing to understand each other's internal workings. This encapsulation means developers can focus on using the API's functionalities without being concerned about the underlying implementation details.

Query: What two elements define an API?

Number of contexts: 3

[Context 1]
The document does not explicitly state the two elements that define an API. It explains what an API is, its importance, and provides examples, but it does not list defining elements.

[Context 2]
The two elements that define an API are protocols and instructions.

[Context 3]
Two elements that define an API are: 1. **Endpoints**: These are specific URLs or addresses where the API can be accessed to interact with resources. 2. **Methods (HTTP Verbs)**: These define the actions that can be performed on the resources at the endpoints, such as GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), PATCH (partial update), and DELETE (remove).
