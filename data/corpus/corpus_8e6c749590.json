      "ctx": [
        "The article suggests spot cleaning stubborn stains on running shoes as a preliminary step before washing them in a washing machine. For mildly dirty shoes, it recommends using a dry brush and a damp cloth. First, clap the soles together to remove excess dirt and mud. Then, lightly buff the outsole and upper with the brush. Use the damp cloth to scrub any caked-on dirt. Remove and wipe down the insoles with a damp cloth. Finally, air dry the shoes and insoles separately in a well-ventilated area, potentially with brief exposure to sunlight. For muddy shoes, after removing excess mud and scrubbing the outsoles with a firm bristle brush, use a toothbrush with mild detergent or diluted hydrogen peroxide to scrub stubborn stains and scuffs on the upper knit and inside the shoe. A toothpick can be used for crevices on the outsole and around eyelets, and a Q-tip can clean along seams inside the shoe. After rinsing, air dry the shoes.",
        "The recommended method for spot cleaning running shoes involves using a soft brush or cloth dipped in a cleaning solution made of warm water and a small amount of mild detergent or sneaker cleaner. The article advises against using harsh chemicals or bleach. For specific materials, it suggests using a soft brush and diluted detergent for mesh or knit uppers, being gentle to avoid fraying, and rinsing with a damp cloth. For synthetic leather, a soft cloth dipped in soapy water followed by a clean damp cloth is recommended. For suede or nubuck, spot cleaning with a suede cleaner and avoiding water is advised, using a dry brush and suede eraser. For natural leather, a leather cleaner or mild soap with a damp cloth is suggested, avoiding soaking or scrubbing. The article also mentions using baby wipes for quick cleanups after dusty or dry runs.",
        "The article recommends spot cleaning for specific stains on running shoes. The method depends on the type of stain: * **Grass Stains:** Use an enzyme-based cleaner, followed by washing with regular detergent and water. * **Grease Stains:** Sprinkle baking soda or cornstarch on the stain to absorb the oil, let it sit for a few hours, then wash as usual. * **Paint Stains:** For the rubber parts of the sneakers, use a cotton ball or swab soaked in acetone (nail polish remover) as an eraser. Rinse and wash afterward. * **Yellowing/Dingy Soles:** Mix baking soda and white vinegar into a paste, apply to the sole, let it sit for several minutes, then rinse and wash. * **Scuffs:** Use a Magic Eraser with light pressure, then rinse and wash."

      "q": "According to the article, what is the ideal fit for women's running shoes?",
      "ctx": [
        "The article states that running shoes should fit comfortably right out of the box, without feeling too snug or stiff. The ideal fit should allow your foot to feel comfortable and supported without being squeezed, but not so loose that you are \"swimming around in it.\" Specifically, for women's running shoes: * **Toe Box:** There should be about a thumb's width or half an inch of space between the longest toe and the end of the shoe. The toes should be able to wiggle and spread out flat without being compressed by the width of the shoe, accommodating natural foot splay. * **Midfoot:** The midfoot should be snug enough to provide decent arch support without feeling compressed from side to side. The shoe's arch support should align with the wearer's natural arch. * **Heel:** The heel cup should be snug but not squeeze the Achilles tendon. Excessive width in the heel can cause slipping, leading to blisters and irritation. * **Upper:** Bony parts of the foot should not feel like they are pressing against the inside mesh of the shoe. * **Overall:** The shape of the shoe's sole should match the wearer's foot shape as closely as possible. If a woman has a rectangular-shaped foot with a broader toe box, she should look for shoes that reflect this. Conversely, if her foot narrows in the toe region, she should seek a shoe shape that matches this taper.",
        "The ideal fit for women's running shoes, as described in the article, involves several key aspects: * **Toe Space:** There should be approximately a thumb's width of space between the longest toe and the end of the shoe. This allows toes to move freely and prevents issues like blisters or black toenails, especially as feet swell during running. * **Midfoot and Heel Fit:** The midfoot and heel should have a snug fit that feels comfortable and prevents slippage. * **Socks:** Wear the same type of socks you intend to run in when trying on shoes. * **Comfort:** Shoes should feel comfortable immediately upon trying them on, with no pressure points or tight areas. * **Support:** The shoes should provide adequate support for the foot's arch and stability during movement. * **Flexibility, Cushioning, and Breathability:** These are important considerations for overall comfort and performance. * **Accommodating Running Style and Terrain:** The shoe should be selected based on individual running style, gait, speed, and the surfaces on which the user trains. * **Foot Shape Considerations:** Different foot shapes (arch height, width, and volume) require specific features. For example, flat arches may benefit from stability shoes, high arches from cushioned shoes, wider feet from shoes designed for broader feet, and higher volume feet from more toe box space. The article also mentions that approximately 68% of runners prefer shoes with a slightly looser fit in the toe box while maintaining a firm fit in the heel.",
        "The article does not specify an \"ideal fit\" exclusively for women's running shoes. However, it provides general guidelines for running shoe fit that would apply to all runners, including women. These guidelines emphasize: * **Toe Box Space:** Approximately a thumb's width (1-1.5 cm) between the longest toe and the end of the shoe. * **Width:** The shoe should not be too narrow (causing blisters or nerve pain) or too wide (leading to instability and slippage). * **Heel Fit:** A secure heel fit to prevent excessive movement and blisters. * **Arch Support:** Appropriate support based on the runner's arch type (high, neutral, or low). * **Overall Comfort:** The shoe should feel comfortable without pinching, squeezing, or causing hot spots, numbness, or tingling. The article also includes a general running shoe size chart that lists US Women's sizes alongside US Men's sizes and foot length in inches."
