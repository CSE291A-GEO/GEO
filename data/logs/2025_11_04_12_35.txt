It also provides the foundational definition of an API. While external contexts also explain how developers use APIs (e.g., for integration and simplification), the candidate article's specific explanation of accessing external services without internal knowledge is a distinct and crucial piece of information.",
    "AD": "The candidate article contributes two out of the three main points in the answer: how developers use APIs to access external services without internal knowledge, and the definition of an API. The third main point (simplifying and accelerating development through integration) comes from an external context.

allows applications to communicate with each other. Developers use APIs to access
data or functionality from external services without knowing their internal implementations.
