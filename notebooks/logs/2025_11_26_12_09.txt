======== Processing Query: I would like to get a new gaming laptop. I'm not knowledgeable enough to go into the specific specs, but it should have one of the highest tier of graphics cards. I would like it to be wide screened. Black, or  maybe a fun colour depending what is available.I prefer a wider screen. The keyboard should have the keys that are a little bit more flat as opposed to the raised, boxier keys. A webcam would be nice but optional. It should definitely have the proper plugin for my headset. Please provide some product recommendations for me ========

======== Processing Query: The laptop I would want as a replacement is one that doesn't just do basic tasks, but is also suitable for artistic tasks like photo editing and video editing. These are two of my hobbies and a basic laptop won't do. I think that would require at least a 4 core processor.

======== Processing Query: I'm looking at new laptops that are made by brands with a good reputation. What's really important is that they have a large hard drive and SSD because I store a lot of photos and SSD is more stable. It would need a good amount of RAM and processing power to ensure that laptop can run smoothly using some intense programs such as Lightroom and can easily cope with a lot of browser tabs open at the same time without sounding like a plane getting ready to take off. Something in a cool colour would be a bonus, but I don't have to have that if the laptop has all the other more important features I want. I'd prefer something that isn't loaded with a lot of pre installed junk that is never really used and often just causes the laptop to slow down. It would need to have a WiFi card and I'd want to get Microsoft Office for it. Please provide some product recommendations for me ========
