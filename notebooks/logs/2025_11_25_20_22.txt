I would like it to be wide screened. Black, or  maybe a fun colour depending what is available.I prefer a wider screen. The keyboard should have the keys that are a little bit more flat as opposed to the raised, boxier keys. A webcam would be nice but optional.

======== Processing Query: The laptop I would want as a replacement is one that doesn't just do basic tasks, but is also suitable for artistic tasks like photo editing and video editing. These are two of my hobbies and a basic laptop won't do. I think that would require at least a 4 core processor.

======== Processing Query: I'm looking at new laptops that are made by brands with a good reputation. What's really important is that they have a large hard drive and SSD because I store a lot of photos and SSD is more stable. It would need a good amount of RAM and processing power to ensure that laptop can run smoothly using some intense programs such as Lightroom and can easily cope with a lot of browser tabs open at the same time without sounding like a plane getting ready to take off. Something in a cool colour would be a bonus, but I don't have to have that if the laptop has all the other more important features I want. I'd prefer something that isn't loaded with a lot of pre installed junk that is never really used and often just causes the laptop to slow down. It would need to have a WiFi card and I'd want to get Microsoft Office for it. Please provide some product recommendations for me ========

  "answer": "Based on your preferences for security, reliability, ease of use, and dedicated in-store support, Apple laptops are a strong choice. The candidate article recommends the **MacBook Air** and **MacBook Pro**.\n\n**Product Recommendations:**\n\n*   **MacBook Air:** This model is highlighted for its minimalist design and portability, weighing 2.75 pounds and being 0.68 inches thick. It's equipped with Apple's M1 chip (8-core CPU, 7-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine), capable of handling demanding tasks like video editing and 3D modeling, outperforming competitors like the Dell XPS 13 and HP Envy 13 in benchmarks. Starting at $999, it's considered an affordable option with customization available for processor, memory, and storage.\n*   **MacBook Pro:** Designed for professionals, it offers larger 15-inch and 16-inch display options and includes a Touch Bar. Also featuring Apple's M1 chip, it excels in demanding tasks such as video editing (rendering a 4K video in 10 minutes compared to 20 minutes for the Dell XPS 15), 3D modeling, and software development. The MacBook Pro starts at $1,299, representing a significant investment for professionals.\n\n**Addressing Your Preferences:**\n\n*   **Security:** Apple laptops are generally considered more secure than Windows laptops, with macOS being less vulnerable to malware (0.06% of macOS users affected vs. 4.24% of Windows users). Built-in security features include Touch ID, Face ID, Gatekeeper, XProtect (scans apps for malware), FileVault (encrypts data), and Find My Mac. Regular software updates further enhance security.\n*   **Reliability:** Apple laptops have a reputation for high reliability and durability, with many users reporting years of trouble-free use. They typically last 5-7 years, and sometimes 10 years or more with proper care.\n*   **Ease of Use:** Known for an intuitive interface and seamless user experience, macOS is designed to be user-friendly with a clean interface and built-in apps. Features like Night Shift reduce eye strain, and Touch ID enhances usability. Apple laptops also offer seamless integration with other Apple devices via Continuity and iCloud for cloud storage.\n*   **Dedicated Shops and One-to-One Help:** Apple Stores offer Genius Bar appointments, providing users with access to Apple experts for issue resolution or personalized advice, directly addressing your preference for in-store, one-to-one support.",
