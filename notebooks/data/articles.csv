Stay In Touch! As I sit here, surrounded by the indoor jungle I’ve created over the years, I’m reminded of the journey that brought me to this moment. It all started in 2021, a year marked by challenges and uncertainty. I brought home my first Monstera Albo to mark the day my husband was deployed. Little did I know that this plant would not only brighten our space but also ignite a passion for propagation that continues to inspire me today. In this blog post, I’m excited to share with you the insights and lessons I’ve gathered along the way.

So, grab your favorite hot drink, get cozy, and join me as we leap into the world of Monstera Albo propagation a journey that has not only enriched my home but also my soul. Monstera Albo A.K.A Varigated Monstera The variegated Monstera Albo, is a beautiful and sought-after plant, and can be difficult to find in the market due to its limited availability. I remember when I ran across my first monstera albo in a local Facebook Plant Group. It had these big “Swiss cheese” leaves (leaves with holes within them) and beautiful white variegation, creating a captivating contrast that immediately drew me in. I’ve always been drawn to variegated plants, if you look at my collection now, the majority of them have some type of variegation. I love the contrast between the green and white. Why Propagate the Monstera Albo Since the albo’s are hard to come by (unless you want to pay a hefty price tag), it’s contributed to an increased interest in propagating the plant. Propagati on is the process that allows you to create new plants from an existing one. Think of it like this, instead of buying a new plant, you’re simply cutting your mature plant and if successful you’ll have two new plants. Your top cutting will continue to produce leaves as long as it grows roots and Your mature plant will push out a new leaf from the growth point. Now you’ll have two plants instead of one and you didn’t have to pay anything except your own time and effort. Although it sounds easy enough, it does require a careful hand, attention to detail, the right tools, and a bit of patience. Before You Get Started There are different ways to propagate your Monstera Albo. Some of these methods are easier than others, but regardless they all produce the same end result. The main ways to propagate your plant: Air Layering Separation Cuttings When it comes to my plants, I usually use the cutting method , and then place my fresh cut into water to allow it to root, while leaving my mature plant in the pot to sprout a new leaf there. This tends to be the most popular method. Although I have used air layering on my larger monstera deliciosa plant, it is not my “go-to” method but it is the “lowest risk.” In this blog post, I’ll only be covering propagation via cuttings. When to Propagate You can propagate your plants at any time during the year however there are times that are “better” than others. I try to only propagate my monsteras during active growing season , which means not in the winter. Once I notice my plants pushing out new leaves , I take it as a sign that it’s ready to be propagated. This is usually in early spring , depending upon where you live. While living in Texas my plants pushed out new leaves all year long so the timing didn’t matter as much. In New Jersey my plants would stop producing new leaves in the winter but pick back up in March. I watch my plants and take their lead on when to propagate. What You’ll Need for water rooting A Healthy Monstera Albo Plant Clean Scissors or a Razor Blade Fresh Water A Container for Rooting (I always use a clear glass jar. When choosing your container, make sure the opening of your container isn’t narrow. Remember, you’ll have to pull the roots out of this container and if your container narrows at the top you risk hurting your new cutting. ) Step-by-Step Guide Step 1. Find the Node First, you’ll want to examine your monstera plant and find a node. Your node is the key to propagating and is how your cutting will be able to produce a new leaf. A node is typically found at the intersection, please refer to the image below to locate your node. I like to have single node cuttings. Occasionally I’ll have a cutting that has 2-3 stems but wouldn’t make a cut larger than that. You can see in the image below the axillary bud (growth point) is right above the node of your cutting before the internode portion of your stem. This axillary bud is where a new stem will form. Step 2. Cut the Stem After you’ve located your node, it’s time to cut the stem. I usually try to leave at least 2-3 inches or more on my stem if possible. This allows me to have extra stem should I run into any problems with root rot along the. I’ll have plenty of stem to trim back should I need to. Step 3. Cut additional leaves. If your cutting has more than 2-3 leaves, I suggest trimming off any addition leaves. You want your new cutting to focus it’s energy on producing new roots, not maintaining a large number of leaves. I let my new cuttings air dry for a minimum of 10 to 20 minutes before I place them into their new medium (water). Step 4. Place into water. Place your cutting into your clear vase then fill with water about 2 to 3 inches above the node. Your position of your cutting should be upright. Once you have your cutting in the container and covered with water, you’ll place in your preferred location with bright indirect sunlight. Step 5. Change water frequently. You do not have to change the water everyday but you will want to change the water frequently to limit the chance of root rot. While you change your water, monitor the stems of your cuttings for root rot, which will appear as black mushy stems. If you notice rot, immediately remove the affected area with a clean pair of scissors. Allow the stem to callus over for 1-2 days before placing back into fresh water. Healthy roots will be yellow, white, light green, or light brown in color. They will be long and firm to touch. If your roots are slimy or mushy, it can be signs of rot. Step 6. Transition to soil. Once your roots are ready, with thick firm roots, several inches long, it’s ready to transfer out of water and into a new pot with soil. I like to do a mix of soil with perlite for aeration. Place a layer of soil in the bottom of your new container, then you’ll place your roots into the center of this same container, and continue to surround the roots with soil under they’re completely covered. Gently press the soil to stabilize your plant. Do NOT pack the soil. You want your roots to be able to push through the soil as they grow, which means you’ll want to leave your soil loose but not too loose. Conditions to Thrive Monstera’s are tropical plants and thrive in warm temperatures with high levels of humidity. Maintain an indoor temperature between 65 – 85 Provide bright indirect light Regularly mist the plants leaves to boost humidity Feed your plant a fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during growing season Avoid drafty areas, such as open windows, air conditioners, and heaters Commonly Asked Questions Can I just snip a leaf off and place it in water to root? No, the placement of your cut matters. You need to cut below a node. If you cut a stem above the node and place it in water it won’t row roots. Why is my monstera propagation Turing black? If you have a spot on your propagating plant that is turning black, it’s rotting. Usually this is from too much moisture. If you have enough stem, simply cut away the rot, let your cutting callus over for a day or two and then place back in your medium. Is my plant guaranteed to have a successful propagation? Unfortunately, no, not all of your propagated plants will produce a new leaf. What happens if my plant produces an all white leaf? Although these leaves are beautiful, they’ll end up dying. you can either let it die on it’s own or you can snip the white leaf. Can I make more than one cut? If you have more than one node, yes! Will my new leaves unfurl with holes like the mature mother plant? If you only make one cut, your top cut will continue to produce the mature leaves. However, mid cuts will push out a new stem from the growth point and these will once again be juvenile leaves in the beginning with no holes in the leaves. As the plants ages the leaves will once again start to unfurl with holes. Have a Question? If you have a question leave it below in the comments or you can reach me directly on instagram messages.

A node is typically found at the intersection, please refer to the image below to locate your node.
Look for a slightly raised bump or a thicker section on the stem, often with a small aerial root or a dormant bud visible. It might also appear as a circular ring around the stem.
 I like to have single node cuttings. Occasionally I’ll have a cutting that has 2-3 stems but wouldn’t make a cut larger than that.

Once your roots are ready, with thick firm roots, several inches long, it’s ready to transfer out of water and into a new pot with soil.Ideally, your roots should be at least 2-4 inches long. After transplanting, keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, watering when the top inch of soil feels dry. Provide bright, indirect sunlight and allow a few weeks for the Monstera to acclimate, avoiding overwatering or fertilizing during this initial period.

Choose a pot with good drainage holes that is only slightly larger than the root ball. Terracotta pots are often recommended for their breathability. Before planting, gently rinse the roots under lukewarm water to remove any algae or debris. Inspect the roots carefully; if you see any brown, mushy, or smelly sections, trim them away with sterilized scissors. This helps prevent rot in the soil.
 I like to do a mix of soil with perlite for aeration.

best dog food for golden retrievers with skin allergies,Golden Retriever Owners | Our Golden has terrible skin allergies,"Golden Retriever Owners | Our Golden has terrible skin allergies
<p>Skin allergies are a prevalent issue for many Golden Retrievers, often manifesting as atopic dermatitis, a hypersensitivity reaction to environmental allergens. This condition involves an overactive immune response to substances like pollen, dust mites, mold spores, grass, trees, or even household irritants like certain air fresheners or cleaning products. Other types include flea allergy dermatitis (FAD), food allergies, and contact allergies.</p>
<h2>Common Symptoms of Skin Allergies</h2>
<p>Recognizing the signs of skin allergies is crucial for early intervention. Owners should look out for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Intense itching, scratching, licking, or chewing, especially on paws, ears, face, and belly.</li>
    <li>Redness, inflammation, and irritated skin.</li>
    <li>Hair loss or thinning coat, often due to excessive scratching or licking.</li>
    <li>Recurrent ear infections (redness, odor, discharge).</li>
    <li>Skin infections (bacterial or yeast), appearing as hot spots, scabs, or greasy skin.</li>
    <li>Hives or rashes.</li>
    <li>Gastrointestinal issues like vomiting or diarrhea (more common with food allergies).</li>
    <li>Watery or itchy eyes, sneezing, or respiratory issues (with environmental allergies).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managing and Treating Skin Allergies</h2>
<p>Managing skin allergies in Golden Retrievers often requires a multi-faceted approach involving veterinary care, at-home strategies, and preventative measures.</p>
<h3>Veterinary Treatments</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Medications:</b> Veterinarians may prescribe antihistamines and corticosteroids (e.g., Apoquel, Cytopoint, Atopica) to control itching and inflammation; these primarily offer symptomatic relief. For secondary bacterial or yeast infections, antibiotics or antifungals are used, targeting the resulting complications rather than the allergy itself.</li>
    <li><b>Immunotherapy:</b> Allergy shots or drops can desensitize your dog to specific environmental allergens, reducing the severity of reactions over time.</li>
    <li><b>Prescription Diets:</b> For food allergies, a veterinarian may recommend a hydrolyzed protein diet or a novel protein diet to identify and avoid triggers.</li>
    <li><b>Topical Therapies:</b> Medicated shampoos, sprays, and ointments can soothe irritated skin, reduce inflammation, and treat localized infections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>At-Home Care and Prevention</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Regular Bathing:</b> Use hypoallergenic or medicated shampoos to remove allergens, soothe skin, and manage infections.</li>
    <li><b>Dietary Management:</b> If food allergies are suspected, work with your vet to identify and eliminate trigger ingredients. Omega-3 fatty acid supplements can also support skin health.</li>
    <li><b>Environmental Control:</b> Minimize exposure to environmental allergens by regular cleaning, using air purifiers, and washing bedding frequently. Keep windows closed during high pollen seasons.</li>
    <li><b>Flea Prevention:</b> Consistent, year-round use of veterinary-approved flea and tick preventatives is crucial, especially for flea allergy dermatitis.</li>
    <li><b>Ear Cleaning:</b> Regular, gentle cleaning of ears can help prevent recurrent ear infections often associated with allergies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always consult your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your Golden Retriever's specific needs.</p>",4

Men's Clothing Reviews Jackets Review Compare Buying Advice How We Tested The Best Windbreakers of 2025 We tested the top 11 windbreakers from Patagonia, The North Face, Black Diamond, Outdoor Research, and others to find the very best. Looking for the perfect lightweight jacket? We've tested 12 of the best windbreakers to help you easily find the perfect one to stash in your pack. Credit: Aaron Rice By Sam Schild ⋅ Review Editor ⋅ Updated September 11, 2025 Contributions From: Aaron Rice From the chill of autumn to springtime gales, a windbreaker is the ideal lightweight option to keep the elements at bay — there's really no excuse not to carry one of these essential, packable layers in your kit. We selected 11 of the most promising models for side-by-side testing. We hiked to windy mountaintops to test wind-blocking abilities, went out on early morning trail runs to test breathability, and simulated rainy conditions with a garden hose. We wore them around town and packed them in our daypacks on a daily basis. The best wind jacket is the Patagonia Houdini , which is a super lightweight piece that packs down into a small chest pocket. The Houdini is geared towards outdoor adventures where going light is the goal. We also love the Rab Vital Hoody , which has hand pockets and is more affordable than the Houdini. If you're an affordable jacket more than a technical piece, the Columbia Spire Valley is a great value that's super comfortable and has a stylish everyday look. If you think you might need more waterproofing, check out our rain jacket review . For the most durable and weatherproof option, you might want to consider a hardshell jacket . Editor's Note: We updated our windbreaker review on September 12, 2025. We added new models from Columbia, Fjallraven, and Stio, and retested a few of our old favorites to see if anything has changed.

It is a repeat winner at the top of our podium and performs exactly as a windbreaker should: packing down and stowing away until you break it out to protect you from wind or light rain. The entire jacket stuffs into its chest pocket, resulting in a package about the size of a tennis ball. The packed jacket is so lightweight that it easily clips to a belt or a climbing harness or stashes into the smallest corner of your pack. It can even squeeze comfortably into the smallest saddlebags, making it a terrific companion for long bike rides. Our lead tester stated, “ I love that this technical jacket has a design that's at home on a mountaintop but looks good enough to wear around town. ” And even though it will never compare to a rain jacket, the PFAS free DWR coating is at the top of its class and has helped us through many passing rainstorms. SPECIFICATIONS Measured Weight 3.4 oz (M) Material 100% nylon ripstop, DWR finish Pockets 1 zip chest Safety Reflective Material Yes, small reflective logo on chest Stowable Pocket Yes: chest pocket While we love most things about the Houdini , its chest pocket is awkwardly small; barely large enough to accommodate a modern smartphone. If you want the storage, we recommend the Ortovox Merino Windbreaker , which has a larger chest pocket. However, the lightweight nature of every windbreaker makes carrying a heavy phone in the chest pocket annoying. Overall, the Houdini is a multifunctional jacket that's up for all-day alpine adventures, long walks with the dog around town, and evening mountain bike laps. The Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell is another similar piece that's even more lightweight (3.2 ounces to the Houdini's 3.4), but we don't love the fit quite as much as the Houdini.

Check price at Amazon (on sale!) 79 OVERALL SCORE Wind Resistance 7.7 Breathability 8.2 Versatility 8.0 Packability 7.6 Water Resistance 7.5 Weight: 4.8 oz (size Medium) | Pockets: 2 zip (hand) PROS PFC-free DWR coating Stiffened brim on a fully elastic hood Great fit and adjustability Inexpensive CONS Lacks a stowable pocket The Rab Vital Hoody is a versatile, durable, highly technical windbreaker that somehow manages to undercut the price point of most other jackets of this caliber. Other models might weigh less, but the Vital opts for improved functionality thanks to a well-honed feature set. Unique design points like a neck snap let you completely unzip the jacket for venting while still keeping it in place, allowing you to dump heat or adjust midlayers quickly. A stiffened hood brim may look a bit goofy, but it offers extra rain deflection, while a fully elastic hood prevents it from billowing in the wind. “ This supremely versatile jacket remains a mainstay in my pack, no matter the activity, ” our lead tester said. The Vital Hoody features a fluorocarbon-free DWR finish and is one of the few lightweight windbreakers with zippered hand pockets. SPECIFICATIONS Measured Weight 4.8 oz (M) Material 20D Atmos woven nylon with PFC-free DWR Pockets 2 zip hand Safety Reflective Material Yes, reflective logo on chest Stowable Pocket No The Vital Hoody packs down to a small size, but it doesn't have a stow pocket. We use one of the zippered hand pockets to pack it away instead of a stuff sack, but you can't zip the pocket shut afterward. This is a slight drawback that doesn't affect the packability too much, but you can't hang this off your pack or harness as well as you can with the Patagonia Houdini or Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell . Nevertheless, no other jacket in our lineup offers this level of technical, lightweight weather protection at this price point.

Credit: Sam Schild Best Affordable Everyday Jacket Columbia Spire Valley - Men's Check price at Amazon (on sale!) 63 OVERALL SCORE Wind Resistance 7.0 Breathability 6.0 Versatility 7.0 Packability 4.0 Water Resistance 6.0 Weight: 10.6 oz (size Medium) | Pockets: 2 zip (hand) PROS Inexpensive Soft nylon fabric Casual look Fits well CONS Not very packable Less waterproof The Columbia Spire Valley is a very affordable jacket that's made of some of the softest, least slippery material of any windbreaker. It has a casual, not-too-sporty look that's at home on long walks with the dog through the park, evenings on a windy patio, and traveling to cities near or far. It has zippered hand pockets, elastic wrist cuffs, and a hood with cords to tighten around your face when you need a little extra protection from the elements. While not a super technical jacket, the soft material feels better against your bare skin than any other jacket we tested, with the much more expensive Fjallraven High Coast jacket being the exception. The High Coast is made of an organic cotton/polyamide blended fabric, but the Spire Valley's nylon fabric feels about as soft while costing much less than the High Coast. SPECIFICATIONS Measured Weight 10.6 oz (M) Material 100% nylon Pockets 2 zip hand Safety Reflective Material None Stowable Pocket No While the Spire Valley is super comfortable and has a casual look that we love for around town, it's not the most technical jacket. We wouldn't recommend this for long days in the alpine because it's heavier and not as waterproof as other models, such as the Stio Second Light Windshell . However, the Spire Valley doesn't try to be a technical layer, and it feels more like a cozy cotton hoody than the stretch recycled nylon ripstop used in Stio Second Light. “ Sometimes you don't want to look like you just got off the mountain, and this jacket does just that, ” our lead tester stated. The Spire Valley is an excellent choice if you're looking for an everyday jacket that feels good when you pull it on.

Credit: Sam Schild Best Ultralight Option Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt - Men's Read the Review 70 OVERALL SCORE Wind Resistance 8.5 Breathability 6.0 Versatility 5.0 Packability 10.0 Water Resistance 6.0 Weight: 2.2 oz (size Medium) | Pockets: none PROS Very light Fits well Adjustable hood American made CONS No pockets Not stylish The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is by far the lightest windbreaker we've ever tested, weighing more than an ounce less than the next lightest model. “ This is the jacket I reach for on ultralight missions, where every ounce counts, ” as our lead tester put it. This bare-bones design has little by way of features (to keep the weight as low as possible), but it fits well. It has a cinch hood and toggle at the waist hem to provide just enough adjustability to keep the wind out. The 10D nylon fabric with PFC-free DWR coating does an excellent job of trapping heat, and combined with an ultralight puffy jacket, will keep you surprisingly warm when the temperature drops. SPECIFICATIONS Measured Weight 2.2 oz (M) Material 10D nylon fabric, PFC-free DWR Pockets None Safety Reflective Material None Stowable Pocket No Though it's astoundingly light, the Copperfield Wind Shirt sacrifices any semblance of style to achieve this level of ultralight. “ I try not to wear this thing unless I'm far away from other people, ” our lead tester stated, “ It kind of looks like a trash bag with sleeves. ” For most people, the Patagonia Houdini is more than light enough and won't be a fashion faux pas if you stop in town after a day on the trail. However, if you're the type of person who really wants to save an entire ounce while carrying a wind-blocking layer, you can't be concerned with looks. If this is you, the Copperfield Wind Shirt is your best bet. The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt barely weighs two ounces, making it an excellent option for ultralight backpacking.

Surprisingly, it isn't always true that the most expensive is the highest performing. Credit: Jill Rice How We Tested Since 2012, our experts have reviewed over 90 of the best windbreakers on the market. Through research and personal experience, we developed a series of comprehensive tests to evaluate each model side-by-side. We assessed how well each model blocked the wind, paying attention to any spots where wind could pass through. We wore each model around town and on outdoor adventures, hung them on climbing harnesses, wore them over insulating layers to keep warm in the winter, and threw them on for chilly evenings in the park. We tested them in front of a fan and under a garden hose to assess wind and weather resistance. We packed them down, sweated in them, and wore each one for months of testing. We use 5 mutually exclusive metrics to dive deep into how well each windbreaker performs: Wind Resistance ( 30% of total score weighting ) Breathability ( 30% weighting ) Versatility ( 20% weighting ) Packability ( 10% weighting ) Water Resistance ( 10% weighting ) We tested every windbreaker across five metrics, perhaps the most important of which is wind resistance. Credit: Sam Schild Why Trust GearLab Our men's windbreaker jacket testing is led by Sam Schild . Sam is an avid backpacker, trail runner, and cyclist based in Colorado. He is a triple crown thru-hiker, and has completed the Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail, and Appalachian Trail, along with countless other long-distance hiking and bikepacking adventures. Sam is joined by Aaron Rice . Aaron grew up on the Atlantic coastline, learning to ski in Vermont and Maine, and has lived up and down the Rocky Mountains for over a decade. He is familiar with all types of wind and weather and holds a bachelor's degree in atmospheric and climate science. Just ask him, he will happily tell you that “ weather is his jam. ” Aaron now lives in Santa Fe, NM, and wears many professional hats, dividing his work seasonally between farming and writing in the summers and ski patrol and avalanche education in the winters. Aaron often finds himself in some questionably windy situations, whether in the high mountains or out in the desert. If you don't know what we're talking about, visit New Mexico in the spring, and you'll understand. Previous Next We tested each jacket's wind resistance, breathability, versatility, packability, and water resistance. Analysis and Test Results We chose each model after comprehensive research into innovation, popularity, quality, and tons of other factors that make the best windbreakers . Our aim is to provide you with thorough and practical advice so you can make a purchasing decision that best suits your specific needs. Worse Value Better Value What's the Best Value? It is essential to consider the value of any potential purchase. While it is often true that items that cost more often correspond with higher performance, this is not always the case. We have found time and again that some more affordable items perform nearly as well as the most expensive options and present a much better value for most people. The Patagonia Houdini represents an exceptional value in this category. Not only is it our top overall scorer, but it is also cheaper than many other options and remarkably durable. We have used the Houdini for years across a variety of activities, and find that it has a level of versatility that only adds to the overall value. The Patagonia Houdini doesn't cost nearly as much as we'd expect for such an excellent windbreaker. Credit: Sam Schild The Rab Vital Hoody is a technical shell with a much more reasonable price tag than you would expect. This model performed nearly as well as the Houdini across the board, but has different strengths and costs slightly less. The Rab Vital Hoody quickly became a favorite jacket for fall riding in the desert, where you need just a touch of protection to cut the windchill on the descent. The versatility of this jacket is what makes it truly valuable. Credit: Jill Rice The Columbia Spire Valley is an impressively affordable model, and while it isn't the one we'd choose for a mountain ascent, it's more than versatile enough to wear on a chilly hike and has a casual look that you can keep wearing when you go out to dinner afterward. The Columbia Spire Valley costs less than almost every other windbreaker we tested. Credit: Sam Schild While the Charles River Pack-n-Go and Champion Stadium Packable each cost less than the Columbia Spire Valley, we weren't nearly as impressed with either of these models' performance. If you only care about finding the least expensive windbreaker, then you might consider these two. But we found the performance of the Columbia Spire Valley to be worth the few extra bucks you'll pay for it. The Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell is ultralight and packable, but it's also quite expensive and doesn't perform better than our top performers. Credit: Sam Schild Wind Resistance Wind resistance is perhaps the most crucial feature of these jackets. If a windbreaker doesn't block the wind, then it misses the whole point. We tested wind resistance on windy mountain ridges, on chilly days by the lake, during early morning runs and hikes, and while backpacking at high elevations. Most of these jackets do a good job of blocking the wind, and you'll feel the difference in warmth when you throw any of them on when the cold air starts blowing. However, some models make weak points - namely, in the zippers, hood, wrist, and waist hem - that start to show in more demanding environments. The Ortovox Merino Windbreaker , which features a unique fabric made of a combination of Merino wool and polyamide, is one of the most windproof jackets we tested. While wearing this on a windy ridge, we could immediately tell that this jacket does an excellent job of blocking the wind. There was a massive difference in temperature after we put this on and zipped it up while the wind was ripping over the mountain. The Ortovox Merino Windbreaker's Merino and polyamide blended fabric is extremely wind-resistant. Credit: Sam Schild The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is slightly more windproof than the Ortovox Merino Windbreaker. The Copperfield Wind Shirt blocks the wind so well that if you combine it with a lightweight fleece , it will be about as warm as a lightweight puffy jacket. We often carry this and a light fleece for summer backpacking rather than packing a down coat. The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is wind-blocking enough that you might not have to bring a puffy jacket on your next summer backpacking trip to stay warm. Credit: Sam Schild In addition to the nylon fabric weave used in construction, a couple of other factors are vital in a jacket's performance to fight the wind properly. Fit is critical; windbreakers work better when they fit close to the body. Features that help seal out the wind, like elastic sleeve cuffs and drawcords on the hem and hood, also make a massive difference if you are battling a strong, sustained wind. These are easy entry points where the wind can circumvent your carefully woven nylon barrier if they're not dialed. We tested every jacket in side-by-side testing in front of a powerful fan set on high. Credit: Sam Schild The Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell is made of extremely windproof nylon ripstop fabric and has one of the best hood designs for blocking the wind. This jacket has a cinch cord that wraps around your head and lightweight stretch material around the face opening of the hood. These two features combine to seal out the wind very effectively. The Patagonia Houdini has a stretch cinch cord that wraps around your head to hold the hood in place when the wind is howling. Credit: Sam Schild The Patagonia Houdini and Rab Vital Hoody are each nearly as wind-resistant as the other models mentioned above. The Houdini is made of a very wind-resistant material and has a cinch cord that wraps around your head, much like the Black Diamond Distance. The Houdini doesn't have elastic around the hood's face opening like the BD does, which makes it slightly less wind-resistant, but more comfortable overall. The Rab Vital Hoody is very good at blocking the wind on chilly evenings on a bike. Credit: Sam Schild The Rab Vital Hoody is made of highly wind-blocking material as well. It has non-adjustable elastic material sewn around the hood's face opening and a velcro adjuster on the backside, allowing you to tighten the hood ever so slightly. This hood design isn't as effective as the adjustable cinch on the Houdini, but the jacket's overall wind-resistance is still very good. Windbreakers are a nearly perfect companion for bike commuting, especially during the fall or spring shoulder seasons. Credit: Jill Rice Breathability Since windbreakers are often used as an alternative, lightweight outer layer for high-intensity activities, we consider breathability and venting as important as wind resistance. A jacket with no breathability would trap all of your heat and sweat inside the shell, leading to a horrible cycle of overheating, soaking, and then overcooling. Balancing breathability with wind resistance is a challenge since you're essentially asking a jacket to let warm air and moisture out without letting cold air in . In all our years of testing, we still haven't found this “ unicorn ” fabric, but many manufacturers include venting features to help overcome this challenge. We ran hard in every jacket and used side-by-side testing to assess each model's breathability. Credit: Sam Schild Besides the notes we acquired from field testing, we wanted to judge each jacket side-by-side in a situation that would not incorporate the sun's heat. To analyze which jackets offered the best ventilation and kept us from getting clammy, we did high-intensity activities in warm weather with each jacket. Need Sun Protection? Check out our top picks for the best sun shirts to protect from those intense solar rays. All of these jackets are biased toward wind protection, so none of them breathe that well . Some jackets performed better than the rest, often for different reasons. The most breathable models we tested were the Ortovox Merino Windbreaker and Fjallraven High Coast . The Ortovox uses a unique fabric that blends Merino wool and polyamide to create a very breathable fabric. Like the Ortovox's use of natural fibers, the Fjallraven High Coast uses a blend of cotton and polyamide. The natural fibers used in these windbreakers allow more hot air to escape when your body starts to heat up. The Fjallraven High Coast is made of a cotton-polyamide fabric that is more breathable than most of the other jackets made of 100% synthetic materials. Credit: Sam Schild The Rab Vital Hoody is made of breathable woven nylon material. This fabric is woven tightly, so it isn't as breathable as it could be , but this tight weave creates better wind and weather resistance. Rather than sacrifice weather protection, Rab added a snap closure across the chest of the jacket so you can fully unzip it to vent without having the entire jacket flap around in the wind. This allowed us to keep the jacket on longer and saved us the hassle of the on-again, off-again game when we were warming up. The Rab Vital Hoody has a single snap closure that prevents the jacket from flapping in the wind when you unzip it fully to vent. Credit: Sam Schild The Patagonia Houdini is a fairly breathable jacket, and the textured fabric doesn't feel as clammy as the smooth inner linings of most other jackets. We were consistently surprised at how long we could keep this jacket on during high-output activities on days when the hot sun was perpetually covered by fast-moving clouds, causing large swings in temperature. Even when we started to sweat, it took much longer to feel uncomfortably clammy in the Houdini. The Patagonia Houdini's fabric is textured and doesn't feel as uncomfortably clammy as most other jackets when you start to sweat. Credit: Sam Schild Versatility While some outdoor apparel is very purpose-specific, we love it when we can use our gear for multiple activities. We looked at how well each windbreaker fit in over a wide variety of environments and activities. We checked how well each jacket fit, asking questions like: Does it fit over the top of thicker midlayers and puffy jackets? Are the sleeves long enough? How does the waist hem feel, and how do you adjust it? Too baggy or too tight a fit won't allow for a full range of motion in any activity. Checking the hood fits is also important if you plan to wear it over a helmet, beanie, or ball cap. We also noted features that annoyed us: hard-to-manipulate zippers, hood stowing systems that don't hold, drawcords that are hard to pull or release with one hand, and uncomfortable elastic cuffs and hood liners. The Patagonia Houdini is versatile enough to wear on a long hike and stylish enough to wear out to drinks afterward. Credit: Sam Schild Some jackets are designed to be used as standalone layers, in which case we expect them to fit sleeker and closer to the body for optimal performance. Others are meant to be worn more as outer layers, in which case you'll want to make sure there is enough room to layer a light jacket underneath. Windbreakers are an ideal layer for ski touring and mountaineering, but they're also great for much more than that. Credit: Jill Rice The most versatile model is the Patagonia Houdini . Many of the technical windbreakers we tested work nearly as well as the Houdini for technical climbing, mountain biking, and running, but most others didn't seem to fit in as well in the rest of our lives. The Houdini is technical enough to wear for long days in the alpine, yet stylish and comfortable enough to wear for drinks on a chilly patio afterward. It fits loosely enough to layer over a thick midlayer or puffy jacket. It isn't too baggy either, making it ideal to carry as the one layer you throw on over your shirt during summer hikes. The Columbia Spire Valley has a casual look that pairs as well with jeans as it does with athletic shorts or hiking pants. Credit: Sam Schild The Fjallraven High Coast and Columbia Spire Valley are also quite versatile. These jackets fit well, are not too tight or loose, and are all-around comfortable. Though they aren't as great for technical ascents of big mountains or other high-output activities, they're a good option for hikes and won't stand out at a restaurant in the way that the Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell would. The Fjallraven High Coast fits loosely enough to layer over a thick sweater or puffy jacket and is stylish enough to wear out for drinks. Credit: Sam Schild The High Coast and Spire Valley have a casual look that pairs as well with jeans as they do with athletic shorts, while the Distance Wind Shell 's ultra-thin material is slightly see-through and looks out of place in any outfit you'd want to throw on for a night in town. The Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell is ultralight and packable, but the light-colored material is slightly see-through and may stand out as overly sporty in more casual settings. Credit: Sam Schild The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is one of the least versatile windbreakers in the lineup. This jacket is exceptionally lightweight and packable, making it the perfect layer for backpacking. However, beyond ultralight endeavors, the Copperfield Wind Shirt falls flat. Though it fits well and is fantastic for layering underneath, it is the least stylish jacket we've ever worn. Many of our outdoorsy testers aren't particularly concerned with style, and even they felt self-conscious while wearing this jacket at a coffee shop after a backpacking trip. The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is a great layer for backpacking trips, but it sacrifices any semblance of style to achieve that ultralight packability. Credit: Sam Schild Packability The lightest windbreakers already weigh substantially less than other jackets and will feel like light work comparatively. Every windbreaker in our review tips the scales at less than a pound, while several weigh less than four ounces. These jackets are not only exceptionally light, but they often pack down smaller than your average Nalgene bottle — so you have little excuse not to throw one of these into your pack for extra weather protection. We rated each product based on weight and how easily it packs away, but weight isn't everything among a crowd of lightweight superstars. We also looked at other packability features that made them easier to carry on your next adventure. Most jackets can be stuffed into their own pocket for easy portability. However, the size they pack down to is not equal, nor is the ease of stuffing or transporting them afterward. A smaller stuffed size is convenient for attaching a windbreaker to a harness on a long climb or fitting in a hydration pack for a long mountain bike ride or trail run. A few windbreakers have separate stuff sacks, but we don't like this as much because they are easy to lose, and they add weight. Every windbreaker we tested packs down to a relatively small size. Credit: Sam Schild The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is the lightest jacket in our lineup. It weighs barely more than 2 ounces. It has no pockets, which makes it lighter, but if you want to hang it off your pack or harness, you'll need to track down a stuff sack. For backpacking, we simply stuff the Copperfield Wind Shirt into an outside pocket, but we didn't find it as convenient for climbing, where you often want to clip a light layer onto your harness. The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is the lightest jacket we tested, but lacks any pockets you can use as a stuff sack. Credit: Sam Schild The Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell is another of the lightest jackets in this review. This jacket stuffs into a very small package in its zippered chest pocket. It's a full ounce heavier than the Copperfield Wind Shirt, but the Distance is a better option if you want something to hang off your climbing harness or backpack without using a separate stuff sack. Many of these lightweight jackets feature carabiner loops and are designed to be hung from a climbing harness. Even the “ least packable ” options are far more convenient to carry than other shells. Credit: Jill Rice The Patagonia Houdini is a fraction of an ounce heavier than the Distance Wind Shell and packs into its chest pocket to about the same size. Though the Houdini is technically heavier, these two models are nearly identical regarding packability. The Patagonia Houdini easily packs away into the chest pocket when you aren't wearing it. Credit: Sam Schild Most of the other jackets in our testing lineup also pack into their own pockets in one way or another, and many have zippered pockets that double as stuff sacks. The Rab Men's Vital Hoody , Columbia Spire Valley , Fjallraven High Coast Wind , and the Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt (mentioned above) lack a dedicated stowable pocket. Past versions of the Rab Vital Hoody came with a stuff sack, but the current one does not. You can stuff this jacket into a hand pocket, though it doesn't have double-sided zippers to close it when inside-out. The Rab Vital Hoody is lightweight and packable, but doesn't have a pocket designed to double as a stuff sack. Credit: Sam Schild You can also use the hand pockets to stuff the Fjallraven High Coast and Columbia Spire Valley in the same way, but these models are not nearly as light and packable, and their hand pockets are less ideal for using as a stuff sack. The Rab Vital Hoody can fit in a half-sized frame bag with plenty of room to spare, even though it technically doesn't have a stuff sack pocket. Credit: Sam Schild The Champion Stadium Packable packs into its hand pocket, but the lining of the pocket is a soft white material that will undoubtedly show dirt and stains over time. While this isn't a huge deal, we do think it's worth noting since most of the other stuff sack pockets aren't nearly as prone to staining. The Champion Stadium Packable's stuff sack pocket is lined with a very stainable white material that will surely absorb dirt over time. Credit: Sam Schild Water Resistance While all these windbreakers purport to be water resistant, none are meant to be as waterproof as a rain jacket . It is a tall order to ask for a jacket that is already wind-resistant, breathable, lightweight, and packable to also be waterproof. We have yet to find such a unicorn, but we still found that many of these jackets were enough to keep dry under a light sprinkle of rain. Most of these jackets come with a durable water-resistant (DWR) coating applied to the shell. DWR coatings are chemical applications that repel water while allowing the fabric underneath to breathe. But a DWR coating wears off over time, especially if you wear a pack over the jacket. Once the DWR coating is gone, these jackets will no longer be water-resistant, and you will get wet. Luckily, you can reapply DWR coatings at home pretty easily. We wore every jacket under a garden hose sprinkler to test how waterproof they were. Credit: Sam Schild We set up a garden hose to simulate a rainstorm, threw on each jacket (with the hood covering our heads), and stood under the falling water for 30 seconds. We performed this test with every jacket and assessed how well each kept us dry in a short torrential rain. The results ranged from impressively good to very bad. The Rab Vital Hoody's DWR coating causes water to bead up on the shell, allowing you to shake it dry after a brief storm. Credit: Sam Schild The most waterproof model is the Rab Vital Hoody . This jacket kept us relatively dry under our simulated torrential downpour. While it's still not as waterproof as a dedicated rain jacket, this model has very water-resistant material and thoughtful features that add to its stormworthiness. It has the most substantial brim on the hood, which will keep your face dryer during a rain shower. During brief showers, the Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell kept us dry, and we could shake off most of the water afterward. Credit: Sam Schild The Ortovox Merino Windbreaker , Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell , Patagonia Houdini , and Cotopaxi Teca Half-Zip Windbreaker were also quite waterproof compared to other windbreakers. While on a day in the mountains, all these jackets kept us dry in brief sprinkles. They also took a full 30 seconds to begin to wet out on the shoulders under heavy water falling out of our garden hose sprinkler shower. The Patagonia Houdini is waterproof enough to keep you dry during a brief afternoon shower. Credit: Sam Schild Water resistance is a nice feature in a windbreaker, but it is certainly not what these jackets are designed for. We wouldn't choose any of these jackets if we knew we were walking out the door on a rainy day, so don't let this be a dealbreaker. Windbreakers are a great choice for keeping you dry and protected from the elements on ski tours. Credit: Jill Rice Conclusion Choosing the perfect windbreaker jacket can be challenging due to the nuances of sport-specific design. The products we reviewed here certainly did a good job of protecting us from the wind. Some were better suited to water resistance, while others were much lighter.

Men's Clothing Reviews Jackets Review Compare Buying Advice How We Tested The Best Windbreakers of 2025 We tested the top 11 windbreakers from Patagonia, The North Face, Black Diamond, Outdoor Research, and others to find the very best. Looking for the perfect lightweight jacket? We've tested 12 of the best windbreakers to help you easily find the perfect one to stash in your pack. Credit: Aaron Rice By Sam Schild ⋅ Review Editor ⋅ Updated September 11, 2025 Contributions From: Aaron Rice From the chill of autumn to springtime gales, a windbreaker is the ideal lightweight option to keep the elements at bay — there's really no excuse not to carry one of these essential, packable layers in your kit. We selected 11 of the most promising models for side-by-side testing. We hiked to windy mountaintops to test wind-blocking abilities, went out on early morning trail runs to test breathability, and simulated rainy conditions with a garden hose. We wore them around town and packed them in our daypacks on a daily basis. The best wind jacket is the Patagonia Houdini , which is a super lightweight piece that packs down into a small chest pocket. The Houdini is geared towards outdoor adventures where going light is the goal. We also love the Rab Vital Hoody , which has hand pockets and is more affordable than the Houdini. If you're an affordable jacket more than a technical piece, the Columbia Spire Valley is a great value that's super comfortable and has a stylish everyday look. If you think you might need more waterproofing, check out our rain jacket review . For the most durable and weatherproof option, you might want to consider a hardshell jacket . Editor's Note: We updated our windbreaker review on September 12, 2025. We added new models from Columbia, Fjallraven, and Stio, and retested a few of our old favorites to see if anything has changed.

It is a repeat winner at the top of our podium and performs exactly as a windbreaker should: packing down and stowing away until you break it out to protect you from wind or light rain. The entire jacket stuffs into its chest pocket, resulting in a package about the size of a tennis ball. The packed jacket is so lightweight that it easily clips to a belt or a climbing harness or stashes into the smallest corner of your pack. It can even squeeze comfortably into the smallest saddlebags, making it a terrific companion for long bike rides. Our lead tester stated, “ I love that this technical jacket has a design that's at home on a mountaintop but looks good enough to wear around town. ” And even though it will never compare to a rain jacket, the PFAS free DWR coating is at the top of its class and has helped us through many passing rainstorms. SPECIFICATIONS Measured Weight 3.4 oz (M) Material 100% nylon ripstop, DWR finish Pockets 1 zip chest Safety Reflective Material Yes, small reflective logo on chest Stowable Pocket Yes: chest pocket While we love most things about the Houdini , its chest pocket is awkwardly small; barely large enough to accommodate a modern smartphone. If you want the storage, we recommend the Ortovox Merino Windbreaker , which has a larger chest pocket. However, the lightweight nature of every windbreaker makes carrying a heavy phone in the chest pocket annoying. Overall, the Houdini is a multifunctional jacket that's up for all-day alpine adventures, long walks with the dog around town, and evening mountain bike laps. The Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell is another similar piece that's even more lightweight (3.2 ounces to the Houdini's 3.4), but we don't love the fit quite as much as the Houdini.

Other models might weigh less, but the Vital opts for improved functionality thanks to a well-honed feature set. Unique design points like a neck snap let you completely unzip the jacket for venting while still keeping it in place, allowing you to dump heat or adjust midlayers quickly. A stiffened hood brim may look a bit goofy, but it offers extra rain deflection, while a fully elastic hood prevents it from billowing in the wind. “ This supremely versatile jacket remains a mainstay in my pack, no matter the activity, ” our lead tester said. The Vital Hoody features a fluorocarbon-free DWR finish and is one of the few lightweight windbreakers with zippered hand pockets. SPECIFICATIONS Measured Weight 4.8 oz (M) Material 20D Atmos woven nylon with PFC-free DWR Pockets 2 zip hand Safety Reflective Material Yes, reflective logo on chest Stowable Pocket No The Vital Hoody packs down to a small size, but it doesn't have a stow pocket. We use one of the zippered hand pockets to pack it away instead of a stuff sack, but you can't zip the pocket shut afterward. This is a slight drawback that doesn't affect the packability too much, but you can't hang this off your pack or harness as well as you can with the Patagonia Houdini or Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell . Nevertheless, no other jacket in our lineup offers this level of technical, lightweight weather protection at this price point.

It has a casual, not-too-sporty look that's at home on long walks with the dog through the park, evenings on a windy patio, and traveling to cities near or far. It has zippered hand pockets, elastic wrist cuffs, and a hood with cords to tighten around your face when you need a little extra protection from the elements. While not a super technical jacket, the soft material feels better against your bare skin than any other jacket we tested, with the much more expensive Fjallraven High Coast jacket being the exception. The High Coast is made of an organic cotton/polyamide blended fabric, but the Spire Valley's nylon fabric feels about as soft while costing much less than the High Coast. SPECIFICATIONS Measured Weight 10.6 oz (M) Material 100% nylon Pockets 2 zip hand Safety Reflective Material None Stowable Pocket No While the Spire Valley is super comfortable and has a casual look that we love for around town, it's not the most technical jacket. We wouldn't recommend this for long days in the alpine because it's heavier and not as waterproof as other models, such as the Stio Second Light Windshell . However, the Spire Valley doesn't try to be a technical layer, and it feels more like a cozy cotton hoody than the stretch recycled nylon ripstop used in Stio Second Light. “ Sometimes you don't want to look like you just got off the mountain, and this jacket does just that, ” our lead tester stated. The Spire Valley is an excellent choice if you're looking for an everyday jacket that feels good when you pull it on.

This bare-bones design has little by way of features (to keep the weight as low as possible), but it fits well. It has a cinch hood and toggle at the waist hem to provide just enough adjustability to keep the wind out. The 10D nylon fabric with PFC-free DWR coating does an excellent job of trapping heat, and combined with an ultralight puffy jacket, will keep you surprisingly warm when the temperature drops. SPECIFICATIONS Measured Weight 2.2 oz (M) Material 10D nylon fabric, PFC-free DWR Pockets None Safety Reflective Material None Stowable Pocket No Though it's astoundingly light, the Copperfield Wind Shirt sacrifices any semblance of style to achieve this level of ultralight. “ I try not to wear this thing unless I'm far away from other people, ” our lead tester stated, “ It kind of looks like a trash bag with sleeves. ” For most people, the Patagonia Houdini is more than light enough and won't be a fashion faux pas if you stop in town after a day on the trail. However, if you're the type of person who really wants to save an entire ounce while carrying a wind-blocking layer, you can't be concerned with looks. If this is you, the Copperfield Wind Shirt is your best bet. The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt barely weighs two ounces, making it an excellent option for ultralight backpacking.

Surprisingly, it isn't always true that the most expensive is the highest performing. Credit: Jill Rice How We Tested Since 2012, our experts have reviewed over 90 of the best windbreakers on the market. Through research and personal experience, we developed a series of comprehensive tests to evaluate each model side-by-side. We assessed how well each model blocked the wind, paying attention to any spots where wind could pass through. We wore each model around town and on outdoor adventures, hung them on climbing harnesses, wore them over insulating layers to keep warm in the winter, and threw them on for chilly evenings in the park. We tested them in front of a fan and under a garden hose to assess wind and weather resistance. We packed them down, sweated in them, and wore each one for months of testing. We use 5 mutually exclusive metrics to dive deep into how well each windbreaker performs: Wind Resistance ( 30% of total score weighting ) Breathability ( 30% weighting ) Versatility ( 20% weighting ) Packability ( 10% weighting ) Water Resistance ( 10% weighting ) We tested every windbreaker across five metrics, perhaps the most important of which is wind resistance. Credit: Sam Schild Why Trust GearLab Our men's windbreaker jacket testing is led by Sam Schild . Sam is an avid backpacker, trail runner, and cyclist based in Colorado. He is a triple crown thru-hiker, and has completed the Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail, and Appalachian Trail, along with countless other long-distance hiking and bikepacking adventures. Sam is joined by Aaron Rice . Aaron grew up on the Atlantic coastline, learning to ski in Vermont and Maine, and has lived up and down the Rocky Mountains for over a decade. He is familiar with all types of wind and weather and holds a bachelor's degree in atmospheric and climate science. Just ask him, he will happily tell you that “ weather is his jam. ” Aaron now lives in Santa Fe, NM, and wears many professional hats, dividing his work seasonally between farming and writing in the summers and ski patrol and avalanche education in the winters. Aaron often finds himself in some questionably windy situations, whether in the high mountains or out in the desert. If you don't know what we're talking about, visit New Mexico in the spring, and you'll understand. Previous Next We tested each jacket's wind resistance, breathability, versatility, packability, and water resistance. Analysis and Test Results We chose each model after comprehensive research into innovation, popularity, quality, and tons of other factors that make the best windbreakers . Our aim is to provide you with thorough and practical advice so you can make a purchasing decision that best suits your specific needs. Worse Value Better Value What's the Best Value? It is essential to consider the value of any potential purchase. While it is often true that items that cost more often correspond with higher performance, this is not always the case. We have found time and again that some more affordable items perform nearly as well as the most expensive options and present a much better value for most people. The Patagonia Houdini represents an exceptional value in this category. Not only is it our top overall scorer, but it is also cheaper than many other options and remarkably durable. We have used the Houdini for years across a variety of activities, and find that it has a level of versatility that only adds to the overall value. The Patagonia Houdini doesn't cost nearly as much as we'd expect for such an excellent windbreaker. Credit: Sam Schild The Rab Vital Hoody is a technical shell with a much more reasonable price tag than you would expect. This model performed nearly as well as the Houdini across the board, but has different strengths and costs slightly less. The Rab Vital Hoody quickly became a favorite jacket for fall riding in the desert, where you need just a touch of protection to cut the windchill on the descent. The versatility of this jacket is what makes it truly valuable. Credit: Jill Rice The Columbia Spire Valley is an impressively affordable model, and while it isn't the one we'd choose for a mountain ascent, it's more than versatile enough to wear on a chilly hike and has a casual look that you can keep wearing when you go out to dinner afterward. The Columbia Spire Valley costs less than almost every other windbreaker we tested. Credit: Sam Schild While the Charles River Pack-n-Go and Champion Stadium Packable each cost less than the Columbia Spire Valley, we weren't nearly as impressed with either of these models' performance. If you only care about finding the least expensive windbreaker, then you might consider these two. But we found the performance of the Columbia Spire Valley to be worth the few extra bucks you'll pay for it. The Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell is ultralight and packable, but it's also quite expensive and doesn't perform better than our top performers. Credit: Sam Schild Wind Resistance Wind resistance is perhaps the most crucial feature of these jackets. If a windbreaker doesn't block the wind, then it misses the whole point. We tested wind resistance on windy mountain ridges, on chilly days by the lake, during early morning runs and hikes, and while backpacking at high elevations. Most of these jackets do a good job of blocking the wind, and you'll feel the difference in warmth when you throw any of them on when the cold air starts blowing. However, some models make weak points - namely, in the zippers, hood, wrist, and waist hem - that start to show in more demanding environments. The Ortovox Merino Windbreaker , which features a unique fabric made of a combination of Merino wool and polyamide, is one of the most windproof jackets we tested. While wearing this on a windy ridge, we could immediately tell that this jacket does an excellent job of blocking the wind. There was a massive difference in temperature after we put this on and zipped it up while the wind was ripping over the mountain. The Ortovox Merino Windbreaker's Merino and polyamide blended fabric is extremely wind-resistant. Credit: Sam Schild The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is slightly more windproof than the Ortovox Merino Windbreaker. The Copperfield Wind Shirt blocks the wind so well that if you combine it with a lightweight fleece , it will be about as warm as a lightweight puffy jacket. We often carry this and a light fleece for summer backpacking rather than packing a down coat. The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is wind-blocking enough that you might not have to bring a puffy jacket on your next summer backpacking trip to stay warm. Credit: Sam Schild In addition to the nylon fabric weave used in construction, a couple of other factors are vital in a jacket's performance to fight the wind properly. Fit is critical; windbreakers work better when they fit close to the body. Features that help seal out the wind, like elastic sleeve cuffs and drawcords on the hem and hood, also make a massive difference if you are battling a strong, sustained wind. These are easy entry points where the wind can circumvent your carefully woven nylon barrier if they're not dialed. We tested every jacket in side-by-side testing in front of a powerful fan set on high. Credit: Sam Schild The Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell is made of extremely windproof nylon ripstop fabric and has one of the best hood designs for blocking the wind. This jacket has a cinch cord that wraps around your head and lightweight stretch material around the face opening of the hood. These two features combine to seal out the wind very effectively. The Patagonia Houdini has a stretch cinch cord that wraps around your head to hold the hood in place when the wind is howling. Credit: Sam Schild The Patagonia Houdini and Rab Vital Hoody are each nearly as wind-resistant as the other models mentioned above. The Houdini is made of a very wind-resistant material and has a cinch cord that wraps around your head, much like the Black Diamond Distance. The Houdini doesn't have elastic around the hood's face opening like the BD does, which makes it slightly less wind-resistant, but more comfortable overall. The Rab Vital Hoody is very good at blocking the wind on chilly evenings on a bike. Credit: Sam Schild The Rab Vital Hoody is made of highly wind-blocking material as well. It has non-adjustable elastic material sewn around the hood's face opening and a velcro adjuster on the backside, allowing you to tighten the hood ever so slightly. This hood design isn't as effective as the adjustable cinch on the Houdini, but the jacket's overall wind-resistance is still very good. Windbreakers are a nearly perfect companion for bike commuting, especially during the fall or spring shoulder seasons. Credit: Jill Rice Breathability Since windbreakers are often used as an alternative, lightweight outer layer for high-intensity activities, we consider breathability and venting as important as wind resistance. A jacket with no breathability would trap all of your heat and sweat inside the shell, leading to a horrible cycle of overheating, soaking, and then overcooling. Balancing breathability with wind resistance is a challenge since you're essentially asking a jacket to let warm air and moisture out without letting cold air in . In all our years of testing, we still haven't found this “ unicorn ” fabric, but many manufacturers include venting features to help overcome this challenge. We ran hard in every jacket and used side-by-side testing to assess each model's breathability. Credit: Sam Schild Besides the notes we acquired from field testing, we wanted to judge each jacket side-by-side in a situation that would not incorporate the sun's heat. To analyze which jackets offered the best ventilation and kept us from getting clammy, we did high-intensity activities in warm weather with each jacket. Need Sun Protection? Check out our top picks for the best sun shirts to protect from those intense solar rays. All of these jackets are biased toward wind protection, so none of them breathe that well . Some jackets performed better than the rest, often for different reasons. The most breathable models we tested were the Ortovox Merino Windbreaker and Fjallraven High Coast . The Ortovox uses a unique fabric that blends Merino wool and polyamide to create a very breathable fabric. Like the Ortovox's use of natural fibers, the Fjallraven High Coast uses a blend of cotton and polyamide. The natural fibers used in these windbreakers allow more hot air to escape when your body starts to heat up. The Fjallraven High Coast is made of a cotton-polyamide fabric that is more breathable than most of the other jackets made of 100% synthetic materials. Credit: Sam Schild The Rab Vital Hoody is made of breathable woven nylon material. This fabric is woven tightly, so it isn't as breathable as it could be , but this tight weave creates better wind and weather resistance. Rather than sacrifice weather protection, Rab added a snap closure across the chest of the jacket so you can fully unzip it to vent without having the entire jacket flap around in the wind. This allowed us to keep the jacket on longer and saved us the hassle of the on-again, off-again game when we were warming up. The Rab Vital Hoody has a single snap closure that prevents the jacket from flapping in the wind when you unzip it fully to vent. Credit: Sam Schild The Patagonia Houdini is a fairly breathable jacket, and the textured fabric doesn't feel as clammy as the smooth inner linings of most other jackets. We were consistently surprised at how long we could keep this jacket on during high-output activities on days when the hot sun was perpetually covered by fast-moving clouds, causing large swings in temperature. Even when we started to sweat, it took much longer to feel uncomfortably clammy in the Houdini. The Patagonia Houdini's fabric is textured and doesn't feel as uncomfortably clammy as most other jackets when you start to sweat. Credit: Sam Schild Versatility While some outdoor apparel is very purpose-specific, we love it when we can use our gear for multiple activities. We looked at how well each windbreaker fit in over a wide variety of environments and activities. We checked how well each jacket fit, asking questions like: Does it fit over the top of thicker midlayers and puffy jackets? Are the sleeves long enough? How does the waist hem feel, and how do you adjust it? Too baggy or too tight a fit won't allow for a full range of motion in any activity. Checking the hood fits is also important if you plan to wear it over a helmet, beanie, or ball cap. We also noted features that annoyed us: hard-to-manipulate zippers, hood stowing systems that don't hold, drawcords that are hard to pull or release with one hand, and uncomfortable elastic cuffs and hood liners. The Patagonia Houdini is versatile enough to wear on a long hike and stylish enough to wear out to drinks afterward. Credit: Sam Schild Some jackets are designed to be used as standalone layers, in which case we expect them to fit sleeker and closer to the body for optimal performance. Others are meant to be worn more as outer layers, in which case you'll want to make sure there is enough room to layer a light jacket underneath. Windbreakers are an ideal layer for ski touring and mountaineering, but they're also great for much more than that. Credit: Jill Rice The most versatile model is the Patagonia Houdini . Many of the technical windbreakers we tested work nearly as well as the Houdini for technical climbing, mountain biking, and running, but most others didn't seem to fit in as well in the rest of our lives. The Houdini is technical enough to wear for long days in the alpine, yet stylish and comfortable enough to wear for drinks on a chilly patio afterward. It fits loosely enough to layer over a thick midlayer or puffy jacket. It isn't too baggy either, making it ideal to carry as the one layer you throw on over your shirt during summer hikes. The Columbia Spire Valley has a casual look that pairs as well with jeans as it does with athletic shorts or hiking pants. Credit: Sam Schild The Fjallraven High Coast and Columbia Spire Valley are also quite versatile. These jackets fit well, are not too tight or loose, and are all-around comfortable. Though they aren't as great for technical ascents of big mountains or other high-output activities, they're a good option for hikes and won't stand out at a restaurant in the way that the Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell would. The Fjallraven High Coast fits loosely enough to layer over a thick sweater or puffy jacket and is stylish enough to wear out for drinks. Credit: Sam Schild The High Coast and Spire Valley have a casual look that pairs as well with jeans as they do with athletic shorts, while the Distance Wind Shell 's ultra-thin material is slightly see-through and looks out of place in any outfit you'd want to throw on for a night in town. The Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell is ultralight and packable, but the light-colored material is slightly see-through and may stand out as overly sporty in more casual settings. Credit: Sam Schild The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is one of the least versatile windbreakers in the lineup. This jacket is exceptionally lightweight and packable, making it the perfect layer for backpacking. However, beyond ultralight endeavors, the Copperfield Wind Shirt falls flat. Though it fits well and is fantastic for layering underneath, it is the least stylish jacket we've ever worn. Many of our outdoorsy testers aren't particularly concerned with style, and even they felt self-conscious while wearing this jacket at a coffee shop after a backpacking trip. The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is a great layer for backpacking trips, but it sacrifices any semblance of style to achieve that ultralight packability. Credit: Sam Schild Packability The lightest windbreakers already weigh substantially less than other jackets and will feel like light work comparatively. Every windbreaker in our review tips the scales at less than a pound, while several weigh less than four ounces. These jackets are not only exceptionally light, but they often pack down smaller than your average Nalgene bottle — so you have little excuse not to throw one of these into your pack for extra weather protection. We rated each product based on weight and how easily it packs away, but weight isn't everything among a crowd of lightweight superstars. We also looked at other packability features that made them easier to carry on your next adventure. Most jackets can be stuffed into their own pocket for easy portability. However, the size they pack down to is not equal, nor is the ease of stuffing or transporting them afterward. A smaller stuffed size is convenient for attaching a windbreaker to a harness on a long climb or fitting in a hydration pack for a long mountain bike ride or trail run. A few windbreakers have separate stuff sacks, but we don't like this as much because they are easy to lose, and they add weight. Every windbreaker we tested packs down to a relatively small size. Credit: Sam Schild The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is the lightest jacket in our lineup. It weighs barely more than 2 ounces. It has no pockets, which makes it lighter, but if you want to hang it off your pack or harness, you'll need to track down a stuff sack. For backpacking, we simply stuff the Copperfield Wind Shirt into an outside pocket, but we didn't find it as convenient for climbing, where you often want to clip a light layer onto your harness. The Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt is the lightest jacket we tested, but lacks any pockets you can use as a stuff sack. Credit: Sam Schild The Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell is another of the lightest jackets in this review. This jacket stuffs into a very small package in its zippered chest pocket. It's a full ounce heavier than the Copperfield Wind Shirt, but the Distance is a better option if you want something to hang off your climbing harness or backpack without using a separate stuff sack. Many of these lightweight jackets feature carabiner loops and are designed to be hung from a climbing harness. Even the “ least packable ” options are far more convenient to carry than other shells. Credit: Jill Rice The Patagonia Houdini is a fraction of an ounce heavier than the Distance Wind Shell and packs into its chest pocket to about the same size. Though the Houdini is technically heavier, these two models are nearly identical regarding packability. The Patagonia Houdini easily packs away into the chest pocket when you aren't wearing it. Credit: Sam Schild Most of the other jackets in our testing lineup also pack into their own pockets in one way or another, and many have zippered pockets that double as stuff sacks. The Rab Men's Vital Hoody , Columbia Spire Valley , Fjallraven High Coast Wind , and the Enlightened Equipment Copperfield Wind Shirt (mentioned above) lack a dedicated stowable pocket. Past versions of the Rab Vital Hoody came with a stuff sack, but the current one does not. You can stuff this jacket into a hand pocket, though it doesn't have double-sided zippers to close it when inside-out. The Rab Vital Hoody is lightweight and packable, but doesn't have a pocket designed to double as a stuff sack. Credit: Sam Schild You can also use the hand pockets to stuff the Fjallraven High Coast and Columbia Spire Valley in the same way, but these models are not nearly as light and packable, and their hand pockets are less ideal for using as a stuff sack. The Rab Vital Hoody can fit in a half-sized frame bag with plenty of room to spare, even though it technically doesn't have a stuff sack pocket. Credit: Sam Schild The Champion Stadium Packable packs into its hand pocket, but the lining of the pocket is a soft white material that will undoubtedly show dirt and stains over time. While this isn't a huge deal, we do think it's worth noting since most of the other stuff sack pockets aren't nearly as prone to staining. The Champion Stadium Packable's stuff sack pocket is lined with a very stainable white material that will surely absorb dirt over time. Credit: Sam Schild Water Resistance While all these windbreakers purport to be water resistant, none are meant to be as waterproof as a rain jacket . It is a tall order to ask for a jacket that is already wind-resistant, breathable, lightweight, and packable to also be waterproof. We have yet to find such a unicorn, but we still found that many of these jackets were enough to keep dry under a light sprinkle of rain. Most of these jackets come with a durable water-resistant (DWR) coating applied to the shell. DWR coatings are chemical applications that repel water while allowing the fabric underneath to breathe. But a DWR coating wears off over time, especially if you wear a pack over the jacket. Once the DWR coating is gone, these jackets will no longer be water-resistant, and you will get wet. Luckily, you can reapply DWR coatings at home pretty easily. We wore every jacket under a garden hose sprinkler to test how waterproof they were. Credit: Sam Schild We set up a garden hose to simulate a rainstorm, threw on each jacket (with the hood covering our heads), and stood under the falling water for 30 seconds. We performed this test with every jacket and assessed how well each kept us dry in a short torrential rain. The results ranged from impressively good to very bad. The Rab Vital Hoody's DWR coating causes water to bead up on the shell, allowing you to shake it dry after a brief storm. Credit: Sam Schild The most waterproof model is the Rab Vital Hoody . This jacket kept us relatively dry under our simulated torrential downpour. While it's still not as waterproof as a dedicated rain jacket, this model has very water-resistant material and thoughtful features that add to its stormworthiness. It has the most substantial brim on the hood, which will keep your face dryer during a rain shower. During brief showers, the Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell kept us dry, and we could shake off most of the water afterward. Credit: Sam Schild The Ortovox Merino Windbreaker , Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell , Patagonia Houdini , and Cotopaxi Teca Half-Zip Windbreaker were also quite waterproof compared to other windbreakers. While on a day in the mountains, all these jackets kept us dry in brief sprinkles. They also took a full 30 seconds to begin to wet out on the shoulders under heavy water falling out of our garden hose sprinkler shower. The Patagonia Houdini is waterproof enough to keep you dry during a brief afternoon shower. Credit: Sam Schild Water resistance is a nice feature in a windbreaker, but it is certainly not what these jackets are designed for. We wouldn't choose any of these jackets if we knew we were walking out the door on a rainy day, so don't let this be a dealbreaker. Windbreakers are a great choice for keeping you dry and protected from the elements on ski tours. Credit: Jill Rice Conclusion Choosing the perfect windbreaker jacket can be challenging due to the nuances of sport-specific design. The products we reviewed here certainly did a good job of protecting us from the wind. Some were better suited to water resistance, while others were much lighter. The trick to figuring out which jacket to buy is to figure out how you'll use it. — Sam Schild & Aaron Rice Table of Contents Our Picks of Men's Windbreaker Jackets Best Overall Windbreaker Best Buy for a Technical Jacket Best Affordable Everyday Jacket Best Ultralight Option How We Tested Why Trust GearLab Analysis and Test Results What's the Best Value?

Are women more demanding these days? If so what problems is it causing for generation Y?,"Why Generation Y Females Are Disappointing – Thought.is Skip to content A site by Thought Catalog Thought.is Home About Privacy Statement Why Generation Y Females Are Disappointing By Karyn Rowina There’s been quite the explosion of attention on our princesses lately. Thought Catalog’s own Rachael Sacks , Elite Daily’s Mackenzie Newcomb and the entitled Brooke Hauge, Fakhara Sultana from that recent first date mess, the naked girls on Halloween, and many other accounts of selfie-addicted image-crafters on social media. Barely prepared for the upcoming butt hurt and defensiveness, I thought I’d say my piece on this phenomenon anyway before this generation of women self-destructs. Inspired by the FRUSTRATED experiences that friends and strangers alike have gone through when it came to Gen-Y princesses, the words above are the most frequent terms and labels used to describe these girls—based on consistent observations. Obviously thrown from an emotional bias, but why be delusional to admit that they actually have truth in them? I’m a Gen-Y female myself, who has been—thankfully—given painful reality checks by well-intending people to help me see the light of my character and on how I can improve it. I’m no perfect gem myself. I came to these observations based on many mistakes I’ve made and seeing how self-serving attitudes, self-centeredness and complacency have hurt others around me more than I realized. You name it, I was one of those who took a lot of selfies/”modeling” pictures who had a knack for over-dramatizing everything in my life (and passive-aggressively attention-whoring about it on Facebook), and my automatic response to real life hardships always came in the form of victimizing myself. Being raised in North America, while not rich financially, I still lived comfortably enough to be “spoiled”. In this comfort, it was always easy to take things and people for granted. When most basic things come effortlessly to you, it’s incredibly easy to find other ways to impose difficulties on yourself. It’s human nature to need challenges for growth, granted, but it’s definitely noticeable that a lot of us cause a lot of self-inflicted drama and pain. First World problems, yeah? Now why do I specifically target my fellow females in this entry? This common issue has really affected me because of a LOT of reflective talks with friends. Males and females alike (but mostly male), shared in on their painful experiences from dealing with an emotionally unstable female… usually the type who falls under the character profile mentioned above. A lot of these unnecessarily hurtful experiences can mostly be narrowed down to inconsistent behaviors projected by the girl’s low self-esteem. If you are a Gen-Y, “privileged” first-worlder like I am, you should have enough social experiences to spot those passive-aggressive behaviors that are congruent to having low self-esteem—and not knowing how to own up to it. THE GENDER SHIFT I will have to admit, that more guys lately have been showing MORE proactive actions towards improving themselves, therefore resulting in better displays of well-rounded personalities and intellect. Since younger women have gained a social upper-hand in the last few years due to the sex-sells (or sexism-sells) mainstream culture, it also meant they received a lot more attention, protection, and social advantages. Frankly, we’ve been getting a lot of things our way lately. (Which makes me wonder why we even have room to still be bitchy as hell?) In the mating dance, a lot of guys are getting rejected (unfortunately being labeled creeps or being “friend-zoned”) because women have so many potential mates to choose from. We didn’t have to do too much work until the most alpha of these guys pick us. With this benefit too, we advanced emotionally and socially in our earlier years a lot faster because of easily-acquired experiences and knowledge. In comes the pick-up/seduction industry to help men attract women. This industry is no joke. There is a LOT of powerful material here that has helped men become better people, and also get a psychological upper-hand. Not just with seducing women but to become well-rounded people with strong emotional intuition and leadership qualities. A lot of rejection is a strong motivational force that got these men into polishing themselves—spiritually, physically, mentally, and emotionally— which allow them to “catch up” significantly to women in terms of presence in relationships and other social situations. Hate on the PUA industry all you want. It became an art and gigantic industry for a reason, stemming from the heartaches (and dry spells) of the many vulnerable men that we’ve done so well at demonizing. And for most young women… we’ve slacked off. We hardly initiate things ourselves. Then easily and blindly take actions towards where there is most emotional stimulation (and if you don’t agree with this, just go ahead and try challenging a seasoned pick-up artist in person). Whether it’s explicitly admitted or not, we are still more concerned about our appearances, material belongings, security, self-inflicted dramas, and the delusional notion that people actually give a fuck about our carefully-crafted image and posts on social media. And one of these days, the “right guy/girl” will just appear into our lives because we’re such princesses, and he/she will just add magic into our lives without us working for this person. We expect things to be handed to us. And we have been used to getting things handed to us, which is why chicks can be quite apathetic to rejecting or acting coldly towards people who pursue them. They don’t know what it’s like to earn or work for someone’s attraction. People usually just come to you, right? And all you have to do is accept or decline, right? A girl can be as self-aware as she can be, but as long as you are comfortable, you will be complacent, incredibly apathetic and entitled. Which means you will hardly work or earn your way into someone’s heart from your own initiative and emotional investment. A lot of young women are forgetting how to be PRESENT in conversations and relationships, to be truly EMPATHIC towards other people, to really WORK on their relationships and themselves, and to be truly accountable for their own actions. Has anyone else found that it’s easier to converse or humor with guys than with girls ( more often, but not always )? Or why there are chicks that say they get along better with guys than their fellow females? It’s weird but I think it’s primarily because we forget PRESENCE and to really appreciate the company we have. We’re not humble. And guys are used to having to direct the progression of a relationship. We fall into several habits of self-indulgence and follow whatever copied behaviors and images are deemed glamorous. I call it the Marilyn Monroe-syndrome (aka. ‘I’m a tortured, misunderstood, and destroyed but glamorous woman’), or YOLOing, etc… Why do you think our economy is primarily enabled by women, who make the majority of material purchases? Because we’re so goddamn impressionable. Men are too, but women are much more emotionally moldable. Research the social trends. Why do you think romance, marriage, and weddings became such lucrative businesses for a while? Why do you think the beauty and modeling industries are so large and still constantly profiting? So anyway, I understand that this is a problem most common in –immature girls– (as opposed to grown women). If you’re a well-rounded chick and you’re a solid personality, these observations won’t even scrape you. You simply KNOW that you have a lot to offer. But it’s incredible how much our “airheaded-ness” is still a common issue. Most girls in North American / Westernized cultures are not humble at all, which really skew our perceptions on how to manage relationships. This egoism comes in many forms, no matter how “sweet” the girl’s personality is… Her preoccupation with herself and her inner demons make her completely UNAWARE of how she’s affecting others or how to conduct herself around them. After some experiences, I no longer believe in calling people “haters” when they disagree or criticize a narcissistic action. That is simply an excuse to keep dodging personal accountability and to keep disregarding how you’re affecting other people with your actions, while keeping up the delusional idea that your personal dramas are really worth the spotlight, even though they really aren’t and they don’t add any substance into others’ lives. TL;DR version: Gen-Y females lately are becoming people who are lacking in substance and character… whether they like to believe that fact or not. We are getting made fun of and not taken seriously because of several, consistent narcissistic actions adapted from being in privileged, materialistic and celebrity-worship-centered environments. To put everything in better perspective, why don’t you ask a guy (or another girl) who has dated women all over the world? You are most likely, going to get a humbling reality-check about how, for example, most European and Middle-Eastern women can be total 10s without makeup and have the stellar characteristics, humility and intellect which enhances their beauty even more. How do we stack up when we’re dominantly living in a culture that doesn’t put too much importance in having substance and solid relationship skills? I write this with much love for my fellow Gen-Y females, who I know truly mean no harm to anyone but are only trying to find and create themselves in this life. I am just as inexperienced as you are. But with this in mind, to truly work on most of the things we are getting called out on for, we have to switch our attitudes towards being other-centered and people-serving, while also not neglecting our own health, growth and well-being. A lot of our insecurities and shame translate into a lot of selfish behaviors just to hide them. Our lives will have more meaning and love if we proactively improve our mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well-being, with the motivation of becoming a better person for others, rather than to just be “admired” and spectacled over.

Bad polls. Party divisions. Midterm fears. It’s all back. By Jonathan Lemire Illustration by The Atlantic. Source: Kevin Dietsch / Getty November 19, 2025 Share Save Listen − 1.0 x + 0:00 11:11 Listen to more stories on the Noa app. P resident Donald Trump’s administration has been embroiled in scandal and sloppiness. His own party has defied his political pressure. His senior staff has been beset by infighting. He has sparred with reporters and offered over-the-top praise to an authoritarian with a dire human-rights record. A signature hard-line immigration policy has polled poorly. And Republicans have begun to brace themselves for a disastrous midterm election. That was 2017. But it’s also 2025. Ten months into the president’s second term, Trump 2.0 is for the first time starting to resemble the chaotic original. And that new sense of political weakness in the president has not just emboldened Democrats who have been despondent for much of the past year. It’s also begun to give Republicans a permission structure for pushing back against Trump and jockeying for power with an eye to the elections ahead. This was not the plan. Trump and his inner circle used their four years out of office to create a policy blueprint—drawn substantially from Project 2025—and form a disciplined team of true believers who used their experience with the levers of power to dominate their political opposition. The beginning of Trump’s second term was marked by an unprecedented display of executive authority, as the president dominated a subservient Congress and defied the courts, brought to heel some of the nation’s most formidable institutions and wealthiest people, fulfilled long-held conservative wishes to dramatically shrink the size and influence of the federal government, reoriented the nation’s relationship with the rest of the world, and rammed through legislation that benefited the rich over the working class and the poor. Trump has been a steamroller. But that has begun to change. Voters punished Trump’s party in this month’s elections, seeming to condemn his presidential overreach and the abandonment of his central campaign promise to rehabilitate the nation’s economy. A rare Republican rebellion on Capitol Hill rattled the West Wing and embarrassed the president. And although the White House likes to project a political image of never surrendering, a pair of retreats in the past few days has punctured Trump’s aura of invincibility. F ew things have frustrated Trump like his inability to make Jeffrey Epstein go away. The disgraced sex offender and financier, of course, has been dead for six years. But questions about the powerful men with whom he associated—and the mystery around his death in prison, which was ruled a suicide—created a conspiracy theory in the MAGA base that has overwhelmed the White House. Trump angrily ordered his supporters to let the matter go this past summer but was largely ignored. And then, last week, four GOP lawmakers—some of whom have been among Trump’s most ardent acolytes—triggered a full House vote to release Department of Justice records related to Epstein. Read: Epstein returns at the worst time for Trump Revolt was in the air. One of those defiant lawmakers, the MAGA icon Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, did not buckle, even as Trump called her a traitor. “Let me tell you what a traitor is,” she responded yesterday. “A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves.” GOP leadership signaled to the White House that most lawmakers could not put their name to a vote to protect a pedophile and that the measure would pass easily, two officials told me on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Trump was furious, but he didn’t want to be seen as getting rolled by his own party. Trying to save face, he begrudgingly posted on social media that he would support Republicans who voted to release the files. The measure passed the House yesterday 427–1. It then cleared the Senate by unanimous consent. Trump announced tonight he had signed it. (Questions persist as to whether the Justice Department may try to block the release of some or all of the files, citing a need to protect an ongoing investigation of prominent Democrats that it launched last week at Trump’s request.) The other Trump walk-back came far less dramatically, buried in the text of an executive order released late Friday. But it was no less noteworthy. Trump, as is often said, has few constant ideological stances, yet one is that tariffs will spur economic growth and benefit the consumer. In a tacit admission that tariffs have, in fact, caused prices to rise (as most economists have long said), the administration quietly lifted tariffs on goods such as bananas, beef, and coffee. The reversal came days after Republicans were swept in off-year elections in places such as Virginia, New Jersey, and New York City . Voters made clear that the GOP was not fulfilling its promises on affordability that helped Trump get elected last year. A number of Republican lawmakers loudly insisted that Trump needs to refocus on prices and inflation—defiance reminiscent of when senators voted down the White House–led efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. C haos within the White House was the norm during Trump’s first term. This time around, the president’s team has prioritized professionalism and tried to minimize turnover. Senior-level firings have been rare, and even the president’s deposed national security adviser, Mike Waltz, was given a soft-landing spot as ambassador to the United Nations. Trump’s first administration was plagued by sloppiness; the original travel ban, Trump veterans will remember with a shudder, was hastily scrawled by Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon and not properly reviewed by government attorneys before it was enacted. (It was promptly tossed out by a federal court.) This time, Trump aides vowed they would be methodical and efficient, and for months, they faced little resistance as they rolled out the president’s agenda. But that sense of disorder has returned, and the losses have begun to pile up. Just in the past two weeks: Trump’s prized tariffs were greeted with great skepticism by the Supreme Court, with the justices appearing unsympathetic to the notion that the president could usurp what is normally congressional power on the back of a flimsy declaration of a national emergency. The president’s campaign of retribution may have hit a snag when a federal judge found that the case put forth by Trump’s handpicked interim U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, was marred by a series of errors that could lead to the dismissal of the criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey. And yesterday, a Trump-appointed federal judge issued a rebuke of the methodology used by Republicans in Texas to redistrict the state’s congressional map. (The judge wrote in his opinion that it was “challenging to unpack” all of the “factual, legal, and typographical errors” in a Justice Department letter that claimed that the original districts were to be eliminated because they were created solely on the basis of race.) Trump, desperate for his party to keep control of both houses of Congress next fall, had pushed for a number of GOP-led states to create more Republican seats, but he took a loss in Texas and has been rebuffed by Indiana, meaning that the Democrats—who responded to the Texas push by successfully creating friendly districts in California and may follow suit in Virginia and Maryland—could end up besting the Republicans at their own game. The administration is confident that the Supreme Court will take up the Texas case and ultimately approve the new districts. Read: ‘None of this is good for Republicans’ There have been other recent flashbacks to Trump’s first term. Much like in 2018, the president and the Republicans were on the losing end of a government shutdown. Infighting was frequent during the first Trump administration, as aides tried to knife one another in the press to improve their standing with the boss. There has been less internal dysfunction this time around—especially after Elon Musk departed DOGE —but last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had to publicly ask his supporters to stop criticizing White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles for allegedly blocking his MAHA agenda. And yesterday, the president ignored the CIA’s conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman played a role in the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi—much as in Helsinki in 2018, when Trump famously sided with Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies on Russian election interference. When an ABC News reporter asked about Khashoggi in front of MBS, Trump threatened to revoke the network’s broadcast license. The White House spokesperson Kush Desai told me in a statement that the past two weeks have brought nothing but victories. “President Trump and the Administration have been delivering results since Day One, and the past two weeks have objectively been a continuation of this winning streak for the American people,” he said. But White House aides have privately admitted that this month has been the most challenging stretch of Trump’s second term. Other Republicans have begun to notice. Some of Trump’s closest allies have warned him about polls that show the public is unhappy with some of his extreme moves, including cheering on masked ICE raids and demolishing the East Wing of the White House. Trump has so far been unwilling to do much to take on—or even acknowledge—the problem of affordability, but aides say that plans will be unveiled soon. Meanwhile, an urgency has set in: The calendar churns even for a president who has wielded power in extraordinary ways. Each day closer to next year’s midterms is a reminder that Trump is a lame duck whose time governing with Republicans in charge at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue could soon be coming to a close. Even before then, his sway within his own party appears to be ebbing. One official who worked in both Trump administrations told me, “The president has had absolute loyalty from Republicans this year.” But, the official added, “losing that would be the first step toward losing power—and relevancy.” About the Author Jonathan Lemire Follow Jonathan Lemire is a staff writer at The Atlantic .

Trump and his inner circle used their four years out of office to create a policy blueprint—drawn substantially from Project 2025
, an initiative designed to prepare conservative loyalists to dismantle the administrative state and implement a sweeping 'America First' agenda, including aggressive trade deals, deregulation, and a significant restructuring of federal agencies,
—and form a disciplined team of true believers who used their experience with the levers of power to dominate their political opposition.
This included appointing loyalists to critical positions such as National Security Advisor (initially Mike Waltz), Health and Human Services Secretary (Robert F. Kennedy Jr.), and White House Chief of Staff (Susie Wiles), all intended to ensure a methodical and efficient execution of the president's agenda.
 The beginning of Trump’s second term was marked by an unprecedented display of executive authority, as the president dominated a subservient Congress and defied the courts, brought to heel some of the nation’s most formidable institutions and wealthiest people, fulfilled long-held conservative wishes to dramatically shrink the size and influence of the federal government, reoriented the nation’s relationship with the rest of the world, and rammed through legislation that benefited the rich over the working class and the poor.

The other Trump walk-back came far less dramatically, buried in the text of an executive order released late Friday. But it was no less noteworthy. Trump, as is often said, has few constant ideological stances, yet one is that tariffs will spur economic growth and benefit the consumer. In a tacit admission that tariffs have, in fact, caused prices to rise (as most economists have long said), the administration quietly lifted tariffs on goods such as bananas, beef, and coffee. The reversal came days after Republicans were swept in off-year elections in places such as Virginia, New Jersey, and New York City . Voters made clear that the GOP was not fulfilling its promises on affordability that helped Trump get elected last year. A number of Republican lawmakers loudly insisted that Trump needs to refocus on prices and inflation—defiance reminiscent of when senators voted down the White House–led efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. C haos within the White House was the norm during Trump’s first term. This time around, the president’s team has prioritized professionalism and tried to minimize turnover. Senior-level firings have been rare, and even the president’s deposed national security adviser, Mike Waltz, was given a soft-landing spot as ambassador to the United Nations. Trump’s first administration was plagued by sloppiness; the original travel ban, Trump veterans will remember with a shudder, was hastily scrawled by Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon and not properly reviewed by government attorneys before it was enacted. (It was promptly tossed out by a federal court.) This time, Trump aides vowed they would be methodical and efficient, and for months, they faced little resistance as they rolled out the president’s agenda. But that sense of disorder has returned, and the losses have begun to pile up. Just in the past two weeks: Trump’s prized tariffs were greeted with great skepticism by the Supreme Court, with the justices appearing unsympathetic to the notion that the president could usurp what is normally congressional power on the back of a flimsy declaration of a national emergency. The president’s campaign of retribution may have hit a snag when a federal judge found that the case put forth by Trump’s handpicked interim U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, was marred by a series of errors that could lead to the dismissal of the criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey. And yesterday, a Trump-appointed federal judge issued a rebuke of the methodology used by Republicans in Texas to redistrict the state’s congressional map. (The judge wrote in his opinion that it was “challenging to unpack” all of the “factual, legal, and typographical errors” in a Justice Department letter that claimed that the original districts were to be eliminated because they were created solely on the basis of race.) Trump, desperate for his party to keep control of both houses of Congress next fall, had pushed for a number of GOP-led states to create more Republican seats, but he took a loss in Texas and has been rebuffed by Indiana, meaning that the Democrats—who responded to the Texas push by successfully creating friendly districts in California and may follow suit in Virginia and Maryland—could end up besting the Republicans at their own game. The administration is confident that the Supreme Court will take up the Texas case and ultimately approve the new districts. Read: ‘None of this is good for Republicans’ There have been other recent flashbacks to Trump’s first term. Much like in 2018, the president and the Republicans were on the losing end of a government shutdown. Infighting was frequent during the first Trump administration, as aides tried to knife one another in the press to improve their standing with the boss. There has been less internal dysfunction this time around—especially after Elon Musk departed DOGE —but last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had to publicly ask his supporters to stop criticizing White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles for allegedly blocking his MAHA agenda. And yesterday, the president ignored the CIA’s conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman played a role in the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi—much as in Helsinki in 2018, when Trump famously sided with Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies on Russian election interference. When an ABC News reporter asked about Khashoggi in front of MBS, Trump threatened to revoke the network’s broadcast license. The White House spokesperson Kush Desai told me in a statement that the past two weeks have brought nothing but victories. “President Trump and the Administration have been delivering results since Day One, and the past two weeks have objectively been a continuation of this winning streak for the American people,” he said. But White House aides have privately admitted that this month has been the most challenging stretch of Trump’s second term. Other Republicans have begun to notice. Some of Trump’s closest allies have warned him about polls that show the public is unhappy with some of his extreme moves, including cheering on masked ICE raids and demolishing the East Wing of the White House. Trump has so far been unwilling to do much to take on—or even acknowledge—the problem of affordability, but aides say that plans will be unveiled soon. Meanwhile, an urgency has set in: The calendar churns even for a president who has wielded power in extraordinary ways. Each day closer to next year’s midterms is a reminder that Trump is a lame duck whose time governing with Republicans in charge at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue could soon be coming to a close. Even before then, his sway within his own party appears to be ebbing. One official who worked in both Trump administrations told me, “The president has had absolute loyalty from Republicans this year.” But, the official added, “losing that would be the first step toward losing power—and relevancy.” About the Author Jonathan Lemire Follow Jonathan Lemire is a staff writer at The Atlantic .

It also detailed plans for military ethos restoration, re-evaluation of international alliances, and significant executive action to reverse prior policies and streamline federal agencies, including the establishment of a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

(Sometimes excessive content such as violence is in otherwise redemptive movies.) Entertainment Quality: None Light Moderate Heavy Language Violence Sex Nudity Credits → What You Need To Know: Inspired by true events, BLACK BOOK is a thrilling, intense but excessive Dutch drama about Rachel Stein, a young Jewish woman hiding in Holland in the fall of 1944. Rachel’s safe house is bombed and her family slaughtered. Soon, she finds herself surrounded by Resistance fighters working to infiltrate the Nazi stronghold in Holland. Hiding her Jewish heritage and working at Gestapo headquarters, Rachel must use every tool she has, including her sexuality, to survive. She finds herself in the bed and in the heart of a pragmatic Gestapo officer, who quickly learns of her background yet decides to keep it secret. Lies, deceit, betrayal, and treachery are the rules of the game. Rachel must learn how to play by those rules to survive. BLACK BOOK is thrilling and engaging, with plenty of intrigue and plot twists. It deftly weaves together characters and sub-plots with mastery and skill. The whole movie is a flashback, however, so viewers know that Rachel survives. This undercuts the movie’s jeopardy. Furthermore, the movie contains lots of gratuitous, excessive foul language, graphic violence, sex, and explicit nudity, and lacks a strong, positive moral focus. Content: (H, B, Co, ACap, C, AB, LLL, VVV, SS, NNN, AA, D, MM) General humanist worldview lacking a strong moral or religious focus, set in Holland at the end of World War II, about a Jewish woman who helps the Resistance against the anti-Semitic National Socialists from Germany (who are mostly viewed as villains) but falls in love with a pragmatic Gestapo officer who hides her identity and link to the Resistance because of his feelings of love and compassion for her with a strong mix of differing political ideologies including elements of National Socialism, Communism, some anti-capitalism, and mention of fascism, also some elements of Christianity and Judaism with Scripture quoted, sarcastic mention of one person’s conversion to Christianity, some anti-Semitism during the Nazi regime and one Christian man makes mention that “if the Jews listened to Jesus, they wouldn’t be in this mess right now”; at least 41 obscenities (including several “f” words) and 16 mostly strong profanities; graphic violence includes family is killed when the house is bombed in an air raid, dead bodies are shown, a group of Jews are massacred on a boat by Nazis while trying to escape into liberated territory, several shoot-out scenes where people, two men wrestle and choke each other, a Nazi is executed, liberated people torture the Germans once the Nazi regime has fallen, woman has human waste poured on her, mass graves and dead bodies are shown, and a man is suffocated in a wooden box; strong sexual content includes several scenes of unmarried kissing, implied fornication and depicted sexuality, one scene where people listen on hidden microphone to couple committing fornication, woman strips in front of drunken soldiers as they grab and kiss her, and several scenes of men groping women; full female nudity in a two separate scenes, full frontal male nudity includes a man urinating, several scenes of upper female nudity (mostly in a sexual context), and one scene of captives being forced to strip; major alcohol consumption includes not only light toasts with champagne but also heavy gin drinking and drunkenness both implied and depicted; cigarette smoking in several scenes; and miscellaneous immorality includes lying, deceit, betrayal, treachery, and espionage. More Detail: Inspired by true events, BLACK BOOK is a thrilling, intense but excessive Dutch drama about Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten), a young Jewish woman who falls in love with the Captain of the Gestapo (Sebastian Koch) in Holland in the fall of 1944. The movie begins in Israel in 1956 where an older Rachel recalls her time in Holland at the end of World War II and the fall of the Nazi regime. Cut to 1944, when Rachel’s safe house is bombed and she must race to reunite with her family and cross the border into liberated territory. No sooner is she with her family on the boat to freedom than Nazi officers ambush the boat and everyone is slaughtered. Rachel narrowly escapes the onslaught. Soon, she finds herself surrounded by a team of resistance fighters who are working to infiltrate the heart of the Nazi stronghold in Holland. Dyeing her hair to hide her Jewish heritage and now working at the Gestapo headquarters, she must use every tool she has, including her sexuality, in order to survive. Not long after, she finds herself not only in the bed but also in the heart of one of the chief Gestapo officers, who quickly learns of her Jewish heritage yet decides to keep it secret because of his feelings for her. As the members of the Resistance plan an attack, a turncoat in their team sets an ambush for them. No one can be trusted. Lies, deceit, betrayal, and treachery are the rules of the game, and Rachel must learn how to play by those rules if she is to survive. As far as quality, BLACK BOOK is thrilling and engaging with plenty of intrigue and plot twists. The director deftly weaves together characters and sub-plots with mastery and skill. The movie does fail in one area of the suspense. The audience’s full investment in Rachel’s peril is somewhat nullified by the fact that, at the beginning of the movie, she is safe in Israel in 1956. Thus, seeing her in dangerous situations in 1944 does not hold the gripping emotionalism of “will she or won’t she survive this?” because the audience already knows that she survives. The content is also unfortunately hard. From strong language, graphic violence, sex, and explicit nudity, including full frontal male and female nudity, most audiences will avoid this movie. It illustrates that war and base human survival is not pretty, but the content is gratuitous and unnecessary. For these reasons, along with some anti-Semitic elements and mixed political worldviews lacking a strong moral focus, MOVIEGUIDE® must rate BLACK BOOK as excessive (Minus Three).

Not long after, she finds herself not only in the bed but also in the heart of one of the chief Gestapo officers, who quickly learns of her Jewish heritage yet decides to keep it secret because of his feelings for her. As the members of the Resistance plan an attack, a turncoat in their team sets an ambush for them. No one can be trusted. Lies, deceit, betrayal, and treachery are the rules of the game, and Rachel must learn how to play by those rules if she is to survive. As far as quality, BLACK BOOK is thrilling and engaging with plenty of intrigue and plot twists. The director deftly weaves together characters and sub-plots with mastery and skill. The movie does fail in one area of the suspense. The audience’s full investment in Rachel’s peril is somewhat nullified by the fact that, at the beginning of the movie, she is safe in Israel in 1956. Thus, seeing her in dangerous situations in 1944 does not hold the gripping emotionalism of “will she or won’t she survive this?” because the audience already knows that she survives. The content is also unfortunately hard. From strong language, graphic violence, sex, and explicit nudity, including full frontal male and female nudity, most audiences will avoid this movie. It illustrates that war and base human survival is not pretty, but the content is gratuitous and unnecessary. For these reasons, along with some anti-Semitic elements and mixed political worldviews lacking a strong moral focus, MOVIEGUIDE® must rate BLACK BOOK as excessive (Minus Three).

Download or order up to 50 free copies today. Download PDF Order a printed copy It's important that your doctor is experienced in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or has access to an AML specialist. Doctors use several types of treatment for adults with AML, some at different stages. Treatment for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the M3 subtype of AML, differs from other AML treatments. Learn more about APL and how it’s treated. The information on this page covers how AML is diagnosed in adults. Visit childhood AML to learn about signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment information for children with AML. Types of AML treatment Doctors use several types of approaches and treatment combinations for AML. Open each section below to learn more. Chemotherapy and drug therapy Chemotherapy drugs kill fast-growing cells throughout the body, including both cancer cells and normal, healthy cells. The damage to normal, healthy cells can cause side effects. Chemotherapy is typically given in cycles. Each cycle is made up of a certain number of treatment days, followed by a certain number of rest days. Some patients may also receive targeted therapy. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific types of cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Not all cancers have the same targets. Targeted therapy may be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy. AML patients whose leukemia cells have certain genetic mutations are assigned a specific risk status. Talk to your doctor about treatments available to target specific genetic mutations. See the our fact sheet, Biomarker Testing for Cancer Treatment. Phases of treatment AML chemotherapy treatment consists of multiple phases. Open each section below to learn more. Phase I: Induction therapy The first phase of treatment is induction therapy. The goal of induction is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible in order to achieve (induce) a complete remission. Typically, initial therapy requires a hospital stay of four to six weeks. The most common induction regimen for AML includes cytarabine and an anthracycline drug, such as daunorubicin or idarubicin. This is called the “7+3” regimen, because cytarabine is most often given by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over seven days, while the anthracycline drug is given by an IV infusion in a single dose for three days during the first week of treatment. Other drugs may be added or substituted for higher-risk patients, such as: Midostaurin (Rydapt®) for AML with an FLT3 mutation Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg™) for CD33-positive AML Other drugs may be used as a substiture for the 7+3 regimen including: CPX-351 (Vyxeos®) High-dose cytarabine with idarubicin or daunorubicin and etoposide High-dose cytarabine with mitoxantrone Fludarabine with high-dose cytarabine, idarubicin and a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) Some drugs are given by mouth (orally). Other drugs are inserted directly into the patient’s bloodstream through a central line, a port, or a PICC. At the end of induction therapy, blood and bone marrow tests are done to see how well your treatment is working. A remission is achieved when you no longer have signs and symptoms on AML. If the initial treatment does not induce a remission, induction therapy can be repeated, either with the same drugs or with a new chemotherapy regimen. Most patients develop dangerously low blood cell counts and may become very ill, needing supportive (palliative) care with IV antibiotics and frequent blood transfusions during this time. Even when a complete remission is achieved, some leukemia cells that cannot be seen with a microscope may still remain in the bone marrow. This is referred to as “minimal residual disease (MRD),” also called “measurable residual disease.” Patients who achieve remission after initial treatment but have MRD are at increased risk of disease relapse. Testing for MRD can help doctors identify patients who may benefit from further treatment with intensified therapies, such as allogeneic stem cell transplantation. It is important to get tested for MRD after achieving remission. The tests used most commonly to detect MRD are flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Learn more about MRD in our free fact sheet, Minimal/Measurable Residual Disease (MRD). Phase II: Consolidation therapy ""Consolidation therapy"" is treatment that is given after cancer is in remission following induction therapy. The goal of consolidation therapy is to lower the number of residual leukemia cells in the body or eliminate them entirely to help prevent the leukemia from returning. There are two basic treatment choices for consolidation therapy: Additional intensive chemotherapy Allogeneic stem cell transplantation Patients with favorable risk factors are often given intensive chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine and other drugs for their consolidation therapy. Patients with high-risk AML, based on their prognostic factors, receive more aggressive therapy, such as allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Not all patients can tolerate intensive therapies or even want them. Patients whose comorbidities and performance status make them poor candidates for intensive chemotherapy may still be able to participate in clinical trials. Or they may benefit from lower-intensity therapies which may relieve symptoms, improve quality of life and potentially extend survival. Phase III: Maintenance therapy The third phase of treatment is called “maintenance.” The main objective of maintenance therapy is to deliver a less toxic therapy to prevent relapse after intensive chemotherapy. Maintenance therapy is often an extended course of treatment. Not everyone with AML will receive maintenance therapy. It depends on the subtype, consolidation treatment and risk of relapse. For some adult patients, the doctor may prescribe azacitidine (Onureg®) as maintenance therapy. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement AML cells can spread to the cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid around the brain and spinal cord. This is uncommon, occurring in less than 5 percent of AML patients. Because CNS involvement is rare in cases of AML, doctors often do not test for it at the time of diagnosis unless the patient is experiencing neurologic symptoms, such as headache or confusion. If neurologic symptoms are present, the doctor may order imaging tests and/or a lumbar puncture to determine if there are leukemia cell in the spinal fluid. Treatment for CNS involvement If leukemia cells are found in the spinal fluid, intrathecal chemotherapy is administered, a treatment in which chemotherapy drugs are injected directly into the spinal fluid. Find a list of standard drugs and drugs under clinical study to treat AML in the booklet on this page. Stem cell transplantation For some patients who are in remission and can tolerate intensive chemotherapy, the doctor may recommend stem cell transplantation during the consolidation phase of chemotherapy. First the patient receives intensive chemotherapy, with or without radiation, to kill the remaining leukemic cells in the patient's body. This also destroys the normal stem cells in the patient's bone marrow. After the chemotherapy, the patient receives an infusion of stem cells to replace the stem cells destroyed by the intensive therapy. These new stem cells restore healthy stem cells in the bone marrow that can form new red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. There are two main types of stem cell transplantation Allogeneic stem cell transplantation, using stem cells from a matched or partially matched healthy donor Autologous stem cell transplantation, using stem cells from the patient collected before chemotherapy. (This type of transplant is not typically used for treating AML.) Research to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from stem cell transplantation after their first complete remission is evolving. Studies show that allogeneic stem cell transplantation may benefit fit patients with high-risk or intermediate-risk AML who have an HLA-matched stem cell donor. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation This is the most common type of stem cell transplantation used to treat AML. Allogeneic transplantation uses healthy blood-forming cells from an HLA-matched family member, an unrelated donor, or from umbilical cord blood. The donated stem cells restore the bone marrow’s ability to form new blood cells. Ideally, an allogeneic stem cell transplant will generate a new immune system for the patient. The immune system helps the body fight infections and other diseases. The new immune system also has the potential to recognize and attack any remaining cancer cells. The transplanted immune cells (the graft) perceive the leukemia cells in the body as foreign and destroy them. This is called the “graft-versus-leukemia” (GVL) effect. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation, compared to other treatment approaches, is associated with a higher rate of side effects and mortality in patients. However, it may be considered for patients with higher-risk AML, based on their cytogenetic and molecular test results and other prognostic factors. The decision to perform an allogeneic transplant also depends on other factors, including the following: Age Physical fitness Comorbidities (other medical conditions) Social support (from family members, caregivers, friends, etc.) Patient’s understanding of the potential benefits and risks Reduced-Intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation This type of transplantation may be a treatment option for older patients who cannot tolerate the high doses of chemotherapy used in preparation for a standard allogeneic stem cell transplant. The conditioning therapy used for a reduced-intensity transplant is of lower intensity than that for a standard stem cell transplant. It does not completely destroy the patient’s immune system or treat the AML as intensively. The goal is to have the donor stem cells become established in the patient’s bone marrow and produce white blood cells that will attack the patient’s remaining cancer cells. Graft-versus-host disease A serious risk of allogeneic and reduced-intensity allogenic stem cell transplantation is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which develops if the donor's immune cells attack your normal tissue. GVHD's effects can range from minor to life threatening. Learn more about stem cell transplantation. Clinical trials Taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice for some AML patients. Clinical trials are under way for patients at every treatment stage and for patients in remission. Today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. We continue to invest funds in AML research. Learn more about clinical trials . Get free clinical trial support! Visit our Clinical Trial Support Center (CTSC). Connect with registered nurses with expertise in blood cancers who can personally assist you or your caregiver through each step of the clinical trial process. Finding the best treatment approach for AML Most AML patients, particularly patients with high white cell counts, need treatment soon after diagnosis because the disease can progress rapidly. A number of factors affect the choice and outcome of treatment, including the following: Your AML subtype The results of cytogenetic analysis Whether you have received chemotherapy in the past to treat another type of cancer Whether you have had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or another blood cancer Whether the AML is in your central nervous system Whether your AML has not responded to treatment or has relapsed The presence of systemic infection at diagnosis Your age and general health As you develop a treatment plan with your doctor, be sure to discuss: The goal of treatment The possibility of participating in a clinical trial, where you'll have access to advanced medical treatment that may be more beneficial to you than standard treatment Potential side effects, including long-term and late effects You may find it helpful to bring a loved one with you to your doctor's visits to support you, take notes, and ask follow-up questions. It's a good idea to prepare questions you'd like to ask when you visit your doctor. You can also record your conversations with your doctor and listen more closely when you get home. Learn more about communicating with your blood cancer specialist or find a list of suggested questions to ask your healthcare providers. Other treatment considerations People 60 years and older: AML occurs more frequently in older adults; at least half of patients are older than 60 years of age when the disease is diagnosed. Treatment approaches for these patients range from standard intensive induction chemotherapy to less intensive therapies, or the best supportive care. Additionally, there are a growing number of new treatment options available for older adults. The treatment of AML in older patients is a challenge due to certain factors: Higher occurrence of unfavorable cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in the leukemia cells Difficulty tolerating more intense cancer treatments Comorbidities (other medical problems), including diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, and/or a history of stroke or lung disease Older people who are physically fit and have no serious health problems may benefit from intensive treatment. Fit elderly patients may even be candidates for reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation. Not all people with AML want or can tolerate intensive therapies. Those whose overall health makes them poor candidates for intensive chemotherapy may still be able to participate in clinical trials. They may also benefit from lower-intensity therapies which may relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and potentially extend survival. Childhood AML: If your child is being treated for AML, therapy may differ slightly from that of the average adult's therapy. See childhood AML . AML treatment side effects Both cancer therapy and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can produce side effects. For most patients, side effects are temporary and subside once the body adjusts to therapy or when therapy is completed. For other patients, side effects can be more severe, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The side effects of chemotherapy may vary, depending on the drugs used and the overall health of the patient. Before you undergo treatment, talk with your doctor about potential side effects. Medication and other therapies can prevent or manage many side effects. You may experience side effects depending on: The intensity of chemotherapy The drugs used during therapy Overall health and whether you have any chronic health conditions, such as diabetes or kidney disease The following are side effects common to AML and its treatment, especially chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation: Low blood cell counts AML decreases the production of normal blood cells. In addition, chemotherapy is toxic to both normal blood cells and AML cells. Normal blood cells are eliminated from the marrow along with AML cells. For the patient, this can lead to: Anemia: Low red blood cell count Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count Neutropenia: Low neutrophil (a type of white blood cell) count Patients may need red blood cell and platelet transfusions for a period of several weeks during treatment. After that, blood cell counts usually return to normal. Infection During treatment for AML, the deficiency of neutrophils and monocytes (types of white blood cells) can lead to infection. The risk of infection may be increased because chemotherapy damages the lining of the mouth and intestines, making it easier for bacteria to enter the blood. When the white blood cell count is low and infection risk is increased, antibiotics are given to prevent or treat infection. White blood cell transfusions are generally not used for AML patients, so doctors sometimes use growth factors to help increase a patient’s white blood cell count. However, growth factors are used only in special circumstances, and routine use of these agents is not recommended. Patients and families should practice frequent and vigorous handwashing and take other precautions to avoid exposure to bacteria, viruses and other infection-causing agents. Caregivers of patients who have central lines or ports need to carefully clean the sites, as instructed by the medical team. Seek medical attention immediately if you show any signs of infections, such as: A temperature of 100.4°F or higher Chills Coughing Sore throat Pain during urination Diarrhea Patients with AML are advised to receive certain vaccinations . Speak to your doctor for more information. Learn more about i nfections, iron overload, or low blood counts and how to manage them. Graft-versus-host disease If you undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplantation, you're at high risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The older you are, the higher your risk for GVHD. GVHD develops when the donor's immune cells mistakenly attack the patient's normal cells. GVHD can be mild, moderate or severe—even life threatening. Learn more about graft-versus-host disease. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) This condition occurs when a large number of cancer cells die within a short period of time, releasing their contents into the blood. TLS can be severe during the early phases of treatment, especially for patients who have very high white blood cell counts before they start induction therapy. As the leukemia cells die, they break apart and release their contents into the bloodstream, which changes the normal balance of chemicals in the blood. This can overwhelm the kidneys because they cannot get rid of the substances all at once. Uric acid is one of the chemicals released by dying cancer cells. Very high levels of uric acid and other chemicals can cause severe damage to the kidneys and heart. If untreated, TLS can lead to heart arrhythmias, seizures, loss of muscle control, acute kidney failure, and even death. People with leukemia who are at high risk for or have developed laboratory or clinical evidence of TLS are given drugs, such as allopurinol (Zyloprim®) or rasburicase (Elitek®), which prevent or lessen TLS. Other treatment side effects These side effects are also common: Mouth sores Diarrhea Hair loss Rashes Nausea and vomiting Fatigue Headache Loss of appetite Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling or muscle weakness, usually in the hands or feet) Fertility and reproductive health Chemotherapy may also affect fertility (the ability to have a biological child in the future). Patients concerned about this potential side effect should talk with a fertility specialist before beginning treatment. Learn more about the impact of AML treatment on fertility and reproductive health. Read our free publication, Fertility and Cancer, for more details. Treatment results Treatment results and outcomes vary among patients. Newer treatment therapies, progress in stem cell transplantation, better supportive care, and studies of new drugs in clinical trials are all contributing to improved outcomes and quality of life for people diagnosed with blood cancers. Relapsed and refractory AML Refractory AML Most patients achieve a remission (an absence of signs and symptoms) after initial AML treatment. However, some patients have residual leukemic cells in their marrow even after intensive treatment. Patients who have not achieved complete remission after two cycles of induction chemotherapy are usually diagnosed as having ""refractory AML."" Relapsed AML Some patients reach remission and then have a return of leukemia cells in the marrow and a decrease in normal blood cells. This is referred to as a “relapse” of the disease (or “relapsed AML”). At the time of relapse, repeat genetic testing of the leukemia cells is considered “standard of care,” since the mutations at the time of relapse may be different from when the disease was first diagnosed. This can affect treatment decisions. Treatments for relapsed/refractory AML Treatment options for patients with refractory or relapsed AML may include: A clinical trial Re-treatment with the same induction regimen that produced the patient's first remission Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potential curative option for patients with relapsed AML, and they must be considered fit enough to undergo the procedure. However, recent approval of several new treatments may help patients who cannot undergo a stem cell transplant to live longer with a high quality of life. Targeted therapy: Gilteritinib (Xospata®) for AML with an FLT3 mutation Low-intensity therapy (azacytidine or decitabine) plus sorafenib (Nexavar®) for AML with an FLT3 mutation Enasidenib (Idhifa®) for AML with an IDH2 mutation Ivosidenib (Tibsovo®) for AML with an IDH1 mutation Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg™) for CD33-positive AML Olutasidenib (Rezlidhia™) for AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation Other drug combinations Research is ongoing to determine optimal drug combinations, doses, and administration schedules. Long-term and late effects of treatment Treatment for individuals who have AML sometimes causes effects that continue after treatment ends (long-term effects) or develop much later in life (late effects). Various factors can influence the risk of developing long-term or late effects, including the following: Type and duration of treatment Age at the time of treatment Sex and overall health Most AML patients are treated with an anthracycline, such as daunorubicin. Anthracyclines have been associated with increased risk for heart muscle injury or chronic heart failure. Heart disease may not become apparent until many years after therapy ends. Stem cell transplantation is used to treat some patients with AML. It has been associated with long-term or late effects, including infertility, thyroid dysfunction, chronic fatigue, and risk for developing a second cancer (lymphoma; melanoma of the skin; or cancer of the tongue and salivary glands, central nervous system, bone, soft tissue, and/or thyroid gland). The number of patients who develop secondary cancers is small. These and other possible long-term and late effects can be managed.

Download or order up to 50 free copies today. Download PDF Order a printed copy It's important that your doctor is experienced in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or has access to an AML specialist. Doctors use several types of treatment for adults with AML, some at different stages. Treatment for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the M3 subtype of AML, differs from other AML treatments. Learn more about APL and how it’s treated. The information on this page covers how AML is diagnosed in adults. Visit childhood AML to learn about signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment information for children with AML. Types of AML treatment Doctors use several types of approaches and treatment combinations for AML. Open each section below to learn more. Chemotherapy and drug therapy Chemotherapy drugs kill fast-growing cells throughout the body, including both cancer cells and normal, healthy cells. The damage to normal, healthy cells can cause side effects. Chemotherapy is typically given in cycles. Each cycle is made up of a certain number of treatment days, followed by a certain number of rest days. Some patients may also receive targeted therapy. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific types of cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Not all cancers have the same targets. Targeted therapy may be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy. AML patients whose leukemia cells have certain genetic mutations are assigned a specific risk status. Talk to your doctor about treatments available to target specific genetic mutations. See the our fact sheet, Biomarker Testing for Cancer Treatment. Phases of treatment AML chemotherapy treatment consists of multiple phases. Open each section below to learn more. Phase I: Induction therapy The first phase of treatment is induction therapy. The goal of induction is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible in order to achieve (induce) a complete remission. Typically, initial therapy requires a hospital stay of four to six weeks. The most common induction regimen for AML includes cytarabine and an anthracycline drug, such as daunorubicin or idarubicin. This is called the “7+3” regimen, because cytarabine is most often given by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over seven days, while the anthracycline drug is given by an IV infusion in a single dose for three days during the first week of treatment. Other drugs may be added or substituted for higher-risk patients, such as: Midostaurin (Rydapt®) for AML with an FLT3 mutation Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg™) for CD33-positive AML Other drugs may be used as a substiture for the 7+3 regimen including: CPX-351 (Vyxeos®) High-dose cytarabine with idarubicin or daunorubicin and etoposide High-dose cytarabine with mitoxantrone Fludarabine with high-dose cytarabine, idarubicin and a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) Some drugs are given by mouth (orally). Other drugs are inserted directly into the patient’s bloodstream through a central line, a port, or a PICC. At the end of induction therapy, blood and bone marrow tests are done to see how well your treatment is working. A remission is achieved when you no longer have signs and symptoms on AML. If the initial treatment does not induce a remission, induction therapy can be repeated, either with the same drugs or with a new chemotherapy regimen. Most patients develop dangerously low blood cell counts and may become very ill, needing supportive (palliative) care with IV antibiotics and frequent blood transfusions during this time. Even when a complete remission is achieved, some leukemia cells that cannot be seen with a microscope may still remain in the bone marrow. This is referred to as “minimal residual disease (MRD),” also called “measurable residual disease.” Patients who achieve remission after initial treatment but have MRD are at increased risk of disease relapse. Testing for MRD can help doctors identify patients who may benefit from further treatment with intensified therapies, such as allogeneic stem cell transplantation. It is important to get tested for MRD after achieving remission. The tests used most commonly to detect MRD are flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Learn more about MRD in our free fact sheet, Minimal/Measurable Residual Disease (MRD). Phase II: Consolidation therapy ""Consolidation therapy"" is treatment that is given after cancer is in remission following induction therapy. The goal of consolidation therapy is to lower the number of residual leukemia cells in the body or eliminate them entirely to help prevent the leukemia from returning. There are two basic treatment choices for consolidation therapy: Additional intensive chemotherapy Allogeneic stem cell transplantation Patients with favorable risk factors are often given intensive chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine and other drugs for their consolidation therapy. Patients with high-risk AML, based on their prognostic factors, receive more aggressive therapy, such as allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Not all patients can tolerate intensive therapies or even want them. Patients whose comorbidities and performance status make them poor candidates for intensive chemotherapy may still be able to participate in clinical trials. Or they may benefit from lower-intensity therapies which may relieve symptoms, improve quality of life and potentially extend survival. Phase III: Maintenance therapy The third phase of treatment is called “maintenance.” The main objective of maintenance therapy is to deliver a less toxic therapy to prevent relapse after intensive chemotherapy. Maintenance therapy is often an extended course of treatment. Not everyone with AML will receive maintenance therapy. It depends on the subtype, consolidation treatment and risk of relapse. For some adult patients, the doctor may prescribe azacitidine (Onureg®) as maintenance therapy. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement AML cells can spread to the cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid around the brain and spinal cord. This is uncommon, occurring in less than 5 percent of AML patients. Because CNS involvement is rare in cases of AML, doctors often do not test for it at the time of diagnosis unless the patient is experiencing neurologic symptoms, such as headache or confusion. If neurologic symptoms are present, the doctor may order imaging tests and/or a lumbar puncture to determine if there are leukemia cell in the spinal fluid. Treatment for CNS involvement If leukemia cells are found in the spinal fluid, intrathecal chemotherapy is administered, a treatment in which chemotherapy drugs are injected directly into the spinal fluid. Find a list of standard drugs and drugs under clinical study to treat AML in the booklet on this page. Stem cell transplantation For some patients who are in remission and can tolerate intensive chemotherapy, the doctor may recommend stem cell transplantation during the consolidation phase of chemotherapy. First the patient receives intensive chemotherapy, with or without radiation, to kill the remaining leukemic cells in the patient's body. This also destroys the normal stem cells in the patient's bone marrow. After the chemotherapy, the patient receives an infusion of stem cells to replace the stem cells destroyed by the intensive therapy. These new stem cells restore healthy stem cells in the bone marrow that can form new red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. There are two main types of stem cell transplantation Allogeneic stem cell transplantation, using stem cells from a matched or partially matched healthy donor Autologous stem cell transplantation, using stem cells from the patient collected before chemotherapy. (This type of transplant is not typically used for treating AML.) Research to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from stem cell transplantation after their first complete remission is evolving. Studies show that allogeneic stem cell transplantation may benefit fit patients with high-risk or intermediate-risk AML who have an HLA-matched stem cell donor. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation This is the most common type of stem cell transplantation used to treat AML. Allogeneic transplantation uses healthy blood-forming cells from an HLA-matched family member, an unrelated donor, or from umbilical cord blood. The donated stem cells restore the bone marrow’s ability to form new blood cells. Ideally, an allogeneic stem cell transplant will generate a new immune system for the patient. The immune system helps the body fight infections and other diseases. The new immune system also has the potential to recognize and attack any remaining cancer cells. The transplanted immune cells (the graft) perceive the leukemia cells in the body as foreign and destroy them. This is called the “graft-versus-leukemia” (GVL) effect. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation, compared to other treatment approaches, is associated with a higher rate of side effects and mortality in patients. However, it may be considered for patients with higher-risk AML, based on their cytogenetic and molecular test results and other prognostic factors. The decision to perform an allogeneic transplant also depends on other factors, including the following: Age Physical fitness Comorbidities (other medical conditions) Social support (from family members, caregivers, friends, etc.) Patient’s understanding of the potential benefits and risks Reduced-Intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation This type of transplantation may be a treatment option for older patients who cannot tolerate the high doses of chemotherapy used in preparation for a standard allogeneic stem cell transplant. The conditioning therapy used for a reduced-intensity transplant is of lower intensity than that for a standard stem cell transplant. It does not completely destroy the patient’s immune system or treat the AML as intensively. The goal is to have the donor stem cells become established in the patient’s bone marrow and produce white blood cells that will attack the patient’s remaining cancer cells. Graft-versus-host disease A serious risk of allogeneic and reduced-intensity allogenic stem cell transplantation is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which develops if the donor's immune cells attack your normal tissue. GVHD's effects can range from minor to life threatening. Learn more about stem cell transplantation. Clinical trials Taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice for some AML patients. Clinical trials are under way for patients at every treatment stage and for patients in remission. Today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. We continue to invest funds in AML research. Learn more about clinical trials . Get free clinical trial support! Visit our Clinical Trial Support Center (CTSC). Connect with registered nurses with expertise in blood cancers who can personally assist you or your caregiver through each step of the clinical trial process. Finding the best treatment approach for AML Most AML patients, particularly patients with high white cell counts, need treatment soon after diagnosis because the disease can progress rapidly. A number of factors affect the choice and outcome of treatment, including the following: Your AML subtype The results of cytogenetic analysis Whether you have received chemotherapy in the past to treat another type of cancer Whether you have had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or another blood cancer Whether the AML is in your central nervous system Whether your AML has not responded to treatment or has relapsed The presence of systemic infection at diagnosis Your age and general health As you develop a treatment plan with your doctor, be sure to discuss: The goal of treatment The possibility of participating in a clinical trial, where you'll have access to advanced medical treatment that may be more beneficial to you than standard treatment Potential side effects, including long-term and late effects You may find it helpful to bring a loved one with you to your doctor's visits to support you, take notes, and ask follow-up questions. It's a good idea to prepare questions you'd like to ask when you visit your doctor. You can also record your conversations with your doctor and listen more closely when you get home. Learn more about communicating with your blood cancer specialist or find a list of suggested questions to ask your healthcare providers. Other treatment considerations People 60 years and older: AML occurs more frequently in older adults; at least half of patients are older than 60 years of age when the disease is diagnosed. Treatment approaches for these patients range from standard intensive induction chemotherapy to less intensive therapies, or the best supportive care. Additionally, there are a growing number of new treatment options available for older adults. The treatment of AML in older patients is a challenge due to certain factors: Higher occurrence of unfavorable cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in the leukemia cells Difficulty tolerating more intense cancer treatments Comorbidities (other medical problems), including diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, and/or a history of stroke or lung disease Older people who are physically fit and have no serious health problems may benefit from intensive treatment. Fit elderly patients may even be candidates for reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation. Not all people with AML want or can tolerate intensive therapies. Those whose overall health makes them poor candidates for intensive chemotherapy may still be able to participate in clinical trials. They may also benefit from lower-intensity therapies which may relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and potentially extend survival. Childhood AML: If your child is being treated for AML, therapy may differ slightly from that of the average adult's therapy. See childhood AML . AML treatment side effects Both cancer therapy and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can produce side effects. For most patients, side effects are temporary and subside once the body adjusts to therapy or when therapy is completed. For other patients, side effects can be more severe, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The side effects of chemotherapy may vary, depending on the drugs used and the overall health of the patient. Before you undergo treatment, talk with your doctor about potential side effects. Medication and other therapies can prevent or manage many side effects. You may experience side effects depending on: The intensity of chemotherapy The drugs used during therapy Overall health and whether you have any chronic health conditions, such as diabetes or kidney disease The following are side effects common to AML and its treatment, especially chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation: Low blood cell counts AML decreases the production of normal blood cells. In addition, chemotherapy is toxic to both normal blood cells and AML cells. Normal blood cells are eliminated from the marrow along with AML cells. For the patient, this can lead to: Anemia: Low red blood cell count Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count Neutropenia: Low neutrophil (a type of white blood cell) count Patients may need red blood cell and platelet transfusions for a period of several weeks during treatment. After that, blood cell counts usually return to normal. Infection During treatment for AML, the deficiency of neutrophils and monocytes (types of white blood cells) can lead to infection. The risk of infection may be increased because chemotherapy damages the lining of the mouth and intestines, making it easier for bacteria to enter the blood. When the white blood cell count is low and infection risk is increased, antibiotics are given to prevent or treat infection. White blood cell transfusions are generally not used for AML patients, so doctors sometimes use growth factors to help increase a patient’s white blood cell count. However, growth factors are used only in special circumstances, and routine use of these agents is not recommended. Patients and families should practice frequent and vigorous handwashing and take other precautions to avoid exposure to bacteria, viruses and other infection-causing agents. Caregivers of patients who have central lines or ports need to carefully clean the sites, as instructed by the medical team. Seek medical attention immediately if you show any signs of infections, such as: A temperature of 100.4°F or higher Chills Coughing Sore throat Pain during urination Diarrhea Patients with AML are advised to receive certain non-live vaccinations. Speak to your doctor about which non-live vaccines are appropriate, including flu and COVID-19 vaccines, for more information.
To further reduce risk, patients can wear masks in crowded places, avoid contact with sick individuals, and follow dietary precautions like avoiding raw meats and thoroughly washing produce. While caregivers can assist with meal preparation following food preparation best practices, current research indicates that a strict ""neutropenic diet"" is not consistently supported by recent studies as effectively reducing infection risk for cancer patients with neutropenia. Using an electric shaver prevents skin tears. Discuss non-live flu and COVID-19 vaccines with your doctor. Clean animal bites/scratches immediately and consult a provider. Caregivers should encourage hygiene, limit physical contact, avoid visits if ill, and maintain cleanliness. Patients may also be prescribed antiviral, antibiotic, or antifungal medications. Beyond the listed signs, seek emergency care for visible skin infections, cuts, injuries, or changes in mental status. Always have a clear way to contact your healthcare provider for urgent questions.
 Learn more about i nfections, iron overload, or low blood counts and how to manage them. Graft-versus-host disease If you undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplantation, you're at high risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The older you are, the higher your risk for GVHD. GVHD develops when the donor's immune cells mistakenly attack the patient's normal cells. GVHD can be mild, moderate or severe—even life threatening. Learn more about graft-versus-host disease. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) This condition occurs when a large number of cancer cells die within a short period of time, releasing their contents into the blood. TLS can be severe during the early phases of treatment, especially for patients who have very high white blood cell counts before they start induction therapy. As the leukemia cells die, they break apart and release their contents into the bloodstream, which changes the normal balance of chemicals in the blood. This can overwhelm the kidneys because they cannot get rid of the substances all at once. Uric acid is one of the chemicals released by dying cancer cells. Very high levels of uric acid and other chemicals can cause severe damage to the kidneys and heart. If untreated, TLS can lead to heart arrhythmias, seizures, loss of muscle control, acute kidney failure, and even death. People with leukemia who are at high risk for or have developed laboratory or clinical evidence of TLS are given drugs, such as allopurinol (Zyloprim®) or rasburicase (Elitek®), which prevent or lessen TLS. Other treatment side effects These side effects are also common: Mouth sores Diarrhea Hair loss Rashes Nausea and vomiting Fatigue Headache Loss of appetite Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling or muscle weakness, usually in the hands or feet) Fertility and reproductive health Chemotherapy may also affect fertility (the ability to have a biological child in the future). Patients concerned about this potential side effect should talk with a fertility specialist before beginning treatment. Learn more about the impact of AML treatment on fertility and reproductive health. Read our free publication, Fertility and Cancer, for more details. Treatment results Treatment results and outcomes vary among patients. Newer treatment therapies, progress in stem cell transplantation, better supportive care, and studies of new drugs in clinical trials are all contributing to improved outcomes and quality of life for people diagnosed with blood cancers. Relapsed and refractory AML Refractory AML Most patients achieve a remission (an absence of signs and symptoms) after initial AML treatment. However, some patients have residual leukemic cells in their marrow even after intensive treatment. Patients who have not achieved complete remission after two cycles of induction chemotherapy are usually diagnosed as having ""refractory AML."" Relapsed AML Some patients reach remission and then have a return of leukemia cells in the marrow and a decrease in normal blood cells. This is referred to as a “relapse” of the disease (or “relapsed AML”). At the time of relapse, repeat genetic testing of the leukemia cells is considered “standard of care,” since the mutations at the time of relapse may be different from when the disease was first diagnosed. This can affect treatment decisions. Treatments for relapsed/refractory AML Treatment options for patients with refractory or relapsed AML may include: A clinical trial Re-treatment with the same induction regimen that produced the patient's first remission Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potential curative option for patients with relapsed AML, and they must be considered fit enough to undergo the procedure. However, recent approval of several new treatments may help patients who cannot undergo a stem cell transplant to live longer with a high quality of life. Targeted therapy: Gilteritinib (Xospata®) for AML with an FLT3 mutation Low-intensity therapy (azacytidine or decitabine) plus sorafenib (Nexavar®) for AML with an FLT3 mutation Enasidenib (Idhifa®) for AML with an IDH2 mutation Ivosidenib (Tibsovo®) for AML with an IDH1 mutation Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg™) for CD33-positive AML Olutasidenib (Rezlidhia™) for AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation Other drug combinations Research is ongoing to determine optimal drug combinations, doses, and administration schedules. Long-term and late effects of treatment Treatment for individuals who have AML sometimes causes effects that continue after treatment ends (long-term effects) or develop much later in life (late effects). Various factors can influence the risk of developing long-term or late effects, including the following: Type and duration of treatment Age at the time of treatment Sex and overall health Most AML patients are treated with an anthracycline, such as daunorubicin. Anthracyclines have been associated with increased risk for heart muscle injury or chronic heart failure. Heart disease may not become apparent until many years after therapy ends. Stem cell transplantation is used to treat some patients with AML. It has been associated with long-term or late effects, including infertility, thyroid dysfunction, chronic fatigue, and risk for developing a second cancer (lymphoma; melanoma of the skin; or cancer of the tongue and salivary glands, central nervous system, bone, soft tissue, and/or thyroid gland). The number of patients who develop secondary cancers is small. These and other possible long-term and late effects can be managed.

Its thin, of course, so I combine it with an insulating layer( Thermoball) and the two are surprisingly effective. Even in 20* and light snow, I was only slightly cold wearing these two layers.

I would definitely buy it again. 5 patfish [ I 'm in love with your shell. It keeps me so toasted. Also, so light weight. I thought it was going to be another piece of junk clothing that would blow in the wind while I 'm going down the ski slopes. 5 Tony [ I bought this jacket to replace my Eddie Bauer equivalent jacket that was showing its age. I 'm 5'11 155 lbs and a size medium fits me perfectly. 5 Dave [ Not only is this a great looking piece, this jacket delivers. Perfect for city and nature settings.

I regularly wear this around the house on chilly days and as a base layer in the cold. The fit is great. I typically hover between a medium and a small. I went with the medium. It fits a little loose for me which I do not mind. 5 Boz801 I have purchased 5 of these jackets over 4 years. They are wonderful. Fit well. Wash well.

I went skiing this past weekend on a pretty warm day, 40- 50 degrees. Just a t shirt and the jacket kept me perfectly comfortable, so it ’s not too warm on its own. And I fell in the slushy snow many times and it kept me dry all day! Seems to run pretty big, I ’ m 6 ’ 2 ” 230lbs and it has long sleeves and lots of room for layering. That ’s what I was looking for so no complaints from me. Definitely happy with my purchase. 5 Neal T. Love this jacket so much. Seems solid for all seasons and when super- cold, just layered up underneath. Into early spring now and the vents are great. Runs a little big, but that ’s ok. So freakin stoked! 5 Kirk T. Second time I have bought this jacket . Fits well, durable, layerable, function over fashion, but it's pretty fashionable too. Pit zips are always a winner, can wear the hood over my Smith Vantage helmet and use the breathe through with no need for a neck up. If you do n't have one, you should be getting one ASAP! 5 Jordan D. This jacket has all the features you want, and none you don ’ t need. It ’s insulated where you want it, but not too hot. It ’s perfect for layering, repels water well, and keeps the snow out. I love how the zipper is offset at the top so it ’s not rubbing on your chin all day well!

The quality of these Columbia jackets does not disappoint. I wish the pockets to keep your hands warm had thicker lining. That ’s the only negative I can think of. The rest of the jacket is solid 5 dsgpobbard I bought this in preparation for a trip where I was expecting temps in the low 40s, wind, and rain, but needed a few easily accessible pockets , too. This coat worked perfectly for me, keeping me dry, warm, and relatively protected from the wind( with the hood), too.

It ’s lightweight and airy with deep pockets and is easy to style whether you want a street look or a sporty look. The fabric is great quality and feels cool to touch. It also repels UV! It ’s perfect for me to wear in the spring or fall time as a casual jacket or even as a warm up. You can ’ t go wrong with this jacket and it would also make as a great gift. If I had any feedback, it would be to make the sleeves and bottom part adjustable to have a tighter or looser look if needed. 5 SurIke [ I absolutely love this jacket !! Completely blown away by the feel and design. I love the utility style on this jacket and large pockets for when I ’ m on the go! I ’ ve ran miles and walked all over the city in this jacket and very comfortably. It ’s super light and ultra durable. And no wind breaks through, even when running across golden gate. Totally blown away by the look and feel of this jacket . Even worn it out to grab a bite and got compliments. Love the all black with logo in black as well. Makes for a stealthy and sleek presentation. Highly recommend, and for anyone. 5 MC [ This jacket is so comfy and stylish! It ’ ll be the perfect transitional piece for the fall or maybe even a summer night. It ’s very lightweight and easy to pack and carry and would be really easy to stash away in a tote bag or tie around my waist if needed. I usually wear a women ’s medium in tops, so the men ’s medium is a little big, but I prefer an oversized look for my jackets anyways. The body has a nice loose look but the sleeves are a little long on me, but again, I don ’ t mind it. I like the material which feels like the kind used in parachute pants, but it ’s not swishy and loud. What really stands out to me are little details like the chest pocket which has a stylish little buckle strap as well as a black embroidered Nike logo. These features are functional but also add a cool unique touch. I also love that the side pockets have zippers- I know this is a common feature in men ’s clothing but, believe it or not, not something I see a lot in women ’s clothing!! As a klutz who sometimes drops things, even from my pockets , this extra level of security is really helpful. I can definitely see this piece becoming a staple in my wardrobe and something I can wear on a hike, a flight, or a night out in the city. 5 GP2 [ This top is one of the most comfortable things I ’ ve worn in a long time. It breathes so well. This can be worn from the early months of Spring all the way to the late months of Fall. It ’s roomy and can go well with almost anything else you ’ re wearing. Definitely one of the best outdoor tops Nike has ever produced. 5 STARS! 5 Greenandwhite [ I recently got to try this black Nike woven jacket with a loose fit, and it has quickly become one of my favorite wardrobe pieces. The design is sleek and modern, staying true to Nike's signature style. The loose fit offers a comfortable and relaxed feel, making it perfect for layering over other clothing. The jacket is made from high- quality woven material, which is both lightweight and durable. It provides just the right amount of warmth for cool days without feeling too heavy or cumbersome. The fabric also has a nice texture, adding a bit of visual interest to the overall look. One of the standout features is the jacket 's versatility. It pairs effortlessly with both casual and athletic outfits, making it a great addition to any wardrobe. The black color is classic and goes with everything, while the subtle Nike branding adds a touch of sporty sophistication. The only minor downside is that the loose fit might not be everyone's preference, especially if you prefer a more tailored look. However, for those who appreciate a relaxed and comfortable style, this jacket is a fantastic choice.

I regularly wear this around the house on chilly days and as a base layer in the cold. The fit is great. I typically hover between a medium and a small. I went with the medium. It fits a little loose for me which I do not mind. 5 Boz801 I have purchased 5 of these jackets over 4 years. They are wonderful. Fit well. Wash well.

I went skiing this past weekend on a pretty warm day, 40- 50 degrees. Just a t shirt and the jacket kept me perfectly comfortable, so it ’s not too warm on its own. And I fell in the slushy snow many times and it kept me dry all day! Seems to run pretty big, I ’ m 6 ’ 2 ” 230lbs and it has long sleeves and lots of room for layering. That ’s what I was looking for so no complaints from me. Definitely happy with my purchase. 5 Neal T. Love this jacket so much. Seems solid for all seasons and when super- cold, just layered up underneath. Into early spring now and the vents are great. Runs a little big, but that ’s ok. So freakin stoked! 5 Kirk T. Second time I have bought this jacket . Fits well, durable, layerable, function over fashion, but it's pretty fashionable too. Pit zips are always a winner, can wear the hood over my Smith Vantage helmet and use the breathe through with no need for a neck up. If you do n't have one, you should be getting one ASAP! 5 Jordan D. This jacket has all the features you want, and none you don ’ t need. It ’s insulated where you want it, but not too hot. It ’s perfect for layering, repels water well, and keeps the snow out. I love how the zipper is offset at the top so it ’s not rubbing on your chin all day well!

The quality of these Columbia jackets does not disappoint. I wish the pockets to keep your hands warm had thicker lining. That ’s the only negative I can think of. The rest of the jacket is solid 5 dsgpobbard I bought this in preparation for a trip where I was expecting temps in the low 40s, wind, and rain, but needed a few easily accessible pockets , too. This coat worked perfectly for me, keeping me dry, warm, and relatively protected from the wind( with the hood), too. The lack of an inner pocket was a bit of a miss, but the two outer breast pockets worked well for my phone and( when traveling , and worried about pickpockets) wallet. 5 hotdog0649 [ The fit was perfect, the color is very nice.

It ’s lightweight and airy with deep pockets and is easy to style whether you want a street look or a sporty look. The fabric is great quality and feels cool to touch. It also repels UV! It ’s perfect for me to wear in the spring or fall time as a casual jacket or even as a warm up. You can ’ t go wrong with this jacket and it would also make as a great gift. If I had any feedback, it would be to make the sleeves and bottom part adjustable to have a tighter or looser look if needed. 5 SurIke [ I absolutely love this jacket !! Completely blown away by the feel and design. I love the utility style on this jacket and large pockets for when I ’ m on the go! I ’ ve ran miles and walked all over the city in this jacket and very comfortably. It ’s super light and ultra durable. And no wind breaks through, even when running across golden gate. Totally blown away by the look and feel of this jacket . Even worn it out to grab a bite and got compliments. Love the all black with logo in black as well. Makes for a stealthy and sleek presentation. Highly recommend, and for anyone. 5 MC [ This jacket is so comfy and stylish! It ’ ll be the perfect transitional piece for the fall or maybe even a summer night. It ’s very lightweight and easy to pack and carry and would be really easy to stash away in a tote bag or tie around my waist if needed. I usually wear a women ’s medium in tops, so the men ’s medium is a little big, but I prefer an oversized look for my jackets anyways. The body has a nice loose look but the sleeves are a little long on me, but again, I don ’ t mind it. I like the material which feels like the kind used in parachute pants, but it ’s not swishy and loud. What really stands out to me are little details like the chest pocket which has a stylish little buckle strap as well as a black embroidered Nike logo. These features are functional but also add a cool unique touch. I also love that the side pockets have zippers- I know this is a common feature in men ’s clothing but, believe it or not, not something I see a lot in women ’s clothing!! As a klutz who sometimes drops things, even from my pockets , this extra level of security is really helpful. I can definitely see this piece becoming a staple in my wardrobe and something I can wear on a hike, a flight, or a night out in the city. 5 GP2 [ This top is one of the most comfortable things I ’ ve worn in a long time. It breathes so well. This can be worn from the early months of Spring all the way to the late months of Fall. It ’s roomy and can go well with almost anything else you ’ re wearing. Definitely one of the best outdoor tops Nike has ever produced. 5 STARS! 5 Greenandwhite [ I recently got to try this black Nike woven jacket with a loose fit, and it has quickly become one of my favorite wardrobe pieces. The design is sleek and modern, staying true to Nike's signature style. The loose fit offers a comfortable and relaxed feel, making it perfect for layering over other clothing. The jacket is made from high- quality woven material, which is both lightweight and durable. It provides just the right amount of warmth for cool days without feeling too heavy or cumbersome. The fabric also has a nice texture, adding a bit of visual interest to the overall look. One of the standout features is the jacket 's versatility. It pairs effortlessly with both casual and athletic outfits, making it a great addition to any wardrobe. The black color is classic and goes with everything, while the subtle Nike branding adds a touch of sporty sophistication. The only minor downside is that the loose fit might not be everyone's preference, especially if you prefer a more tailored look. However, for those who appreciate a relaxed and comfortable style, this jacket is a fantastic choice.
