There are also APIs for programming languages, software libraries \"Library (computing)\"), computer operating systems, and computer hardware.

        "## What is an API? An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules or protocols that enables software applications to communicate with each other to exchange data, features and functionality. APIs simplify and accelerate application and software development by enabling developers to integrate data, services and capabilities from other applications, instead of developing them from scratch. Today, most APIs are web APIs. Web APIs are a type of remote API (meaning that the API uses protocols to manipulate external resources) that expose an application's data and functionality over the internet. * **Data (or database) APIs**, used to connect applications and database management systems",
        "What is an API? What is an API call? In order to exchange information between APIs, developers must provide API documentation that describes the types of requests an API can accept, the use cases it is designed to support, and any other conditions (e.g. protocols, schemas, and security requirements) that third parties are required to follow. ## What is an API?

        "APIs enable developers to access functionality without needing to understand the internal workings of the service they're using. For example, you can integrate",
        "If you are an API developer, you must know some fundamental factors in API development. Here are 7 tips to get you started.",
        "Best Practices for Integrating External Data APIs Into Your Application One of the most important aspects of developing current applications is integrating external data APIs (Application Programming Interface). Make sure you understand the API you’re working with before you start writing code. External APIs make your application accessible to new data flows and services, and it is paramount to ensure that interactions are secure from the outset. When consuming APIs that power these kinds of services, managing rate limits becomes a matter of performance and reliability. External APIs are powerful enablers of modern app development. You can enrich your app with location data, scale with cloud services, or both, and the considerate use of APIs will make you move faster, remain agile, and provide better experiences."
